## Development Quality Standards & Implementation Tasks

### 1. Complete Implementation Standards
**Original Task**: Update steering rules that we don't do TODO - always fully build features
**Implementation Actions**:
- Update `.cursor/rules/000-definition-of-done.mdc` to explicitly prohibit TODO comments in production code
- Add steering rule requiring full feature implementation before marking tasks complete
- Establish "no partial implementations" policy in quality standards
- Create steering guidelines that foster a "finish what you start" mentality
- Promote standards where partial work is unacceptable in production

### 2. Pre-Work Assessment Protocol
**Original Task**: Always check what's built before building to avoid duplicate work
**Implementation Actions**:
- Create systematic check for existing implementations before starting new work
- Verify current state of code, tests, and documentation before beginning tasks
- Document what exists vs what needs to be built to avoid duplication
- Use file search and code analysis to understand current implementation status
- Establish rules promoting investigation before implementation
- Foster habits of understanding existing systems before building new ones

### 3. Industry-Standard Development Practices
**Original Task**: Use simple, robust best practices - don't reinvent the wheel
**Implementation Actions**:
- Prioritize proven, well-established solutions over custom implementations
- Use standard libraries and frameworks instead of reinventing functionality
- Ensure all implementations follow robust, maintainable patterns
- Reject hacky or temporary solutions in favor of solid engineering practices
- Create guidelines favoring established, battle-tested approaches
- Foster engineering practices that prioritize maintainability and reliability

### 4. Test Reality Alignment
**Original Task**: Fix tests failing because they expect actual responses rather than mocks
**Implementation Actions**:
- Identify tests failing due to expecting real responses instead of mocks
- Update test implementations to properly handle actual system responses
- Ensure test environments accurately reflect production behavior
- Align test expectations with real-world system interactions
- Establish testing standards that reflect actual system behavior
- Promote test implementations that accurately represent production scenarios

### 5. Complete Test Suite Stabilization
**Original Task**: Stabilize all tests and test suites
**Implementation Actions**:
- Run full test suite analysis to identify all failing tests
- Fix unit, integration, and e2e test failures systematically
- Ensure all test categories pass consistently
- Implement proper test isolation and cleanup
- Create standards for thorough testing across all system layers
- Establish practices ensuring consistent test suite reliability

### 6. Granular Commit Strategy
**Original Task**: Use verbose commits with multiple commits for different areas
**Implementation Actions**:
- Use descriptive, verbose commit messages explaining changes
- Create separate commits for different functional areas
- Commit frequently to avoid large, mixed changesets
- Include context about why changes were made, not just what changed
- Create guidelines for transparent, descriptive development practices
- Establish standards for clear documentation of changes and reasoning

### 7. Quality Gate Enforcement
**Cross-cutting Implementation**:
- Implement automated checks preventing incomplete code from being committed
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are met before task completion
- Verify error handling and edge cases are properly implemented
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality
- Create standards ensuring quality gates prevent incomplete work
- Establish practices where thoroughness is valued over speed
- Foster culture where proper error handling and edge cases are standard
