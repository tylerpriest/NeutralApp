4. Regardless of a tasks status always check whats built before you build, so you don't do duplicate work.
make sure to check for whats built/tested/documented before you start to make sure you dont do dupilicate work

5. Use simple, robust best practices, Don't reinvent the wheel, Don't use custom when you don't have to
