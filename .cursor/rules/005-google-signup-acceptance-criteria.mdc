# Google Signup Acceptance Criteria - EXAMPLE TEMPLATE

## IMPORTANT: This is an EXAMPLE/TEMPLATE
**This file demonstrates how to write comprehensive acceptance criteria for any user story. The Google signup is just an example - you can use this same pattern for any feature in your application.**

## Example User Story
**As a first-time visitor, I want to sign up with Google so I can explore the dashboard instantly.**

## Example Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Format)
**This shows the pattern for writing comprehensive acceptance criteria that cover all scenarios:**

### Feature Structure
```gherkin
@authentication @oauth @google
Feature: Google Sign-up
  As a first-time visitor
  I want to sign up with Google
  So that I can explore the dashboard instantly

  Background:
    Given I am on the landing page
    And I have not signed up before
```

### Tag System
**Use comprehensive tags to organize and filter tests:**
- `@authentication @oauth @google` - Feature-level tags
- `@happy-path @critical` - Priority scenarios
- `@error-handling` - Error scenarios
- `@accessibility @screen-reader @wcag` - Accessibility requirements
- `@performance @load-time` - Performance constraints
- `@network @error-handling` - Network issues
- `@session @security` - Security and session management
- `@onboarding @user-experience` - User experience
- `@edge-case` - Edge cases

### 1. Happy Path - Successful Google Signup
```gherkin
Scenario: Successful Google signup and dashboard access
  Given I am a first-time visitor on the landing page
  And I have a valid Google account
  When I click "Sign up with Google"
  Then I should be redirected to Google OAuth consent screen
  And I should see the app requesting necessary permissions
  When I approve the OAuth request
  Then I should be redirected back to the application
  And I should be automatically logged in
  And I should be taken to the dashboard page
  And I should see a welcome message with my name
  And I should see available plugins to explore
  And the page should load within 2 seconds
  And I should be able to interact with the dashboard immediately
```

### 2. Invalid Credential Path - OAuth Failure (Scenario Outline)
```gherkin
@error-handling @oauth-failure
Scenario Outline: OAuth failure scenarios
  Given I have <credential_type> Google credentials
  When I click "Sign up with Google"
  Then I should be redirected to Google OAuth consent screen
  When Google returns <error_type>
  Then I should be redirected back to the landing page
  And I should see a user-friendly error message
  And the error message should not expose technical details
  And I should be given the option to try again
  And I should be given the option to use email signup instead
  And my session should not be in a broken state

  Examples:
    | credential_type | error_type                    |
    | invalid         | authentication error          |
    | expired         | token expired error           |
    | suspended       | account suspended error       |
    | restricted      | access denied error           |
```

### 3. OAuth Denial Path - User Rejects Permissions
```gherkin
@error-handling @user-denial
Scenario: User denies OAuth permissions
  When I click "Sign up with Google"
  Then I should be redirected to Google OAuth consent screen
  When I deny the OAuth request or close the popup
  Then I should be returned to the landing page
  And I should see a helpful message explaining the benefits of signing up
  And I should see the option to try signing up again
  And I should see alternative signup methods (email, other providers)
  And I should not see any error messages or broken states
  And the page should remain fully functional
```

### 4. Accessibility Requirements
```gherkin
@accessibility @screen-reader @wcag
Scenario: Accessibility compliance for signup flow
  Given I am using a screen reader
  When I navigate to the "Sign up with Google" button
  Then the button should have proper ARIA labels
  And the button should be keyboard accessible
  And the button should have sufficient color contrast
  When I activate the signup flow
  Then all OAuth redirects should be announced to screen readers
  And the dashboard should be fully navigable by keyboard
  And all interactive elements should have proper focus indicators
  And the page should meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
```

### 5. Performance Constraints
```gherkin
@performance @load-time
Scenario: Performance requirements for signup flow
  When I click "Sign up with Google"
  Then the OAuth redirect should happen within 1 second
  And the Google consent screen should load within 2 seconds
  When I approve the OAuth request
  Then I should be redirected back within 1 second
  And the dashboard should load within 2 seconds
  And the page should be fully interactive within 3 seconds total
  And the signup flow should work on slow network connections (3G)
  And the signup flow should work on mobile devices
```

### 6. Network Failure Handling
```gherkin
@network @error-handling
Scenario: Network failure during signup process
  Given my network connection is unstable
  When I click "Sign up with Google"
  And the network request fails
  Then I should see a user-friendly error message
  And I should be given the option to retry
  And I should not lose my place on the page
  And the error should be logged for debugging
  When I retry the signup
  Then the process should continue from where it left off
  And I should not have to start over completely
```

### 7. Session Management
```gherkin
@session @security
Scenario: Proper session establishment after signup
  Given I successfully complete Google signup
  When I am redirected to the dashboard
  Then my session should be properly established
  And I should remain logged in when I refresh the page
  And I should remain logged in when I navigate to other pages
  And my session should persist for at least 24 hours
  And I should be able to log out when desired
  And my session should be secure and encrypted
```

### 8. User Onboarding Flow
```gherkin
@onboarding @user-experience
Scenario: Seamless onboarding after signup
  Given I have just completed Google signup
  When I arrive at the dashboard
  Then I should see a welcome message with my name
  And I should see a brief tour of available features
  And I should see recommended plugins to get started
  And I should see clear next steps for exploring the app
  And I should not be overwhelmed with too many options
  And I should be able to dismiss the onboarding elements
  And I should be able to access help if needed
```

## Example Edge Cases to Consider
**These are examples of edge cases you should think about for any feature:**

### 1. **Browser Compatibility Issues (Scenario Outline)**
```gherkin
@edge-case @browser-compatibility
Scenario Outline: Browser compatibility issues
  Given I am using <browser_type> with <restriction_type>
  When I click "Sign up with Google"
  Then I should see <expected_behavior>
  And I should be given <alternative_option>

  Examples:
    | browser_type | restriction_type           | expected_behavior                    | alternative_option        |
    | Chrome       | disabled popups            | popup blocked message               | redirect flow option      |
    | Firefox      | disabled third-party cookies| cookie warning message             | email signup option       |
    | Safari       | strict privacy settings    | privacy warning message            | alternative auth option   |
    | Edge         | corporate restrictions     | network restriction message        | contact admin option      |
```

### 2. **Account State Issues (Scenario Outline)**
```gherkin
@edge-case @account-state
Scenario Outline: Account state issues
  Given I have a Google account that is <account_state>
  When I click "Sign up with Google"
  Then I should see <appropriate_message>
  And I should be given <resolution_option>

  Examples:
    | account_state | appropriate_message           | resolution_option           |
    | already exists| account already exists message| login option               |
    | suspended     | account suspended message     | contact support option     |
    | requires verification| verification required message| verification flow option |
    | restricted    | access restricted message     | alternative signup option  |
```

### 3. **Technical Edge Cases**
- OAuth provider is temporarily unavailable
- User's device has limited storage or memory
- User is on a corporate network with restrictions
- User's timezone or locale settings cause issues

### 4. **Security Edge Cases**
```gherkin
@security @edge-case
Scenario: Security edge case - session hijacking
  Given I am on an insecure network (public WiFi)
  When I click "Sign up with Google"
  Then I should see a security warning
  And I should be advised to use a secure connection
  And the OAuth flow should use HTTPS
  And my session should be encrypted
  And I should be warned about potential security risks
```

## Example Test Implementation
**These show how to implement tests for the acceptance criteria above:**

### E2E Test Example
```typescript
describe('Google Signup User Story', () => {
  test('User can sign up with Google and explore dashboard instantly', async () => {
    // Given: User is on landing page
    await page.goto('/');
    
    // When: User clicks sign up with Google
    await page.click('[data-testid="google-signup"]');
    
    // Then: OAuth flow should work
    await expect(page).toHaveURL(/accounts\.google\.com/);
    
    // When: User completes OAuth (mock or real)
    await mockGoogleOAuthSuccess();
    
    // Then: User should be on dashboard with value
    await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
    await expect(page.locator('text=Welcome')).toBeVisible();
    await expect(page.locator('text=Available Plugins')).toBeVisible();
    
    // And: Performance should be acceptable
    const loadTime = await page.evaluate(() => performance.now());
    expect(loadTime).toBeLessThan(2000); // 2 seconds
  });
  
  test('User gets helpful error when OAuth fails', async () => {
    await page.goto('/');
    await page.click('[data-testid="google-signup"]');
    
    // Mock OAuth failure
    await mockGoogleOAuthFailure();
    
    await expect(page.locator('text=Unable to sign up right now')).toBeVisible();
    await expect(page.locator('text=Please try again')).toBeVisible();
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="retry-signup"]')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### Integration Test Example
```typescript
describe('Google Signup Integration', () => {
  test('OAuth flow integrates with user management', async () => {
    const mockGoogleUser = {
      id: 'google-123',
      email: 'user@example.com',
      name: 'Test User'
    };
    
    // Mock Google OAuth response
    mockGoogleOAuth(mockGoogleUser);
    
    // Test the integration
    const result = await authService.handleGoogleSignup(mockGoogleUser);
    
    expect(result.user.email).toBe(mockGoogleUser.email);
    expect(result.user.name).toBe(mockGoogleUser.name);
    expect(result.session).toBeDefined();
    expect(result.user.isFirstTime).toBe(true);
  });
});
```
