# Definition of Done Enforcement Rule

Enforces a strict workflow aligned with Kiro's spec-driven development methodology to ensure features are properly specified, designed, tested, implemented, and documented before considering them done.

      # KIRO DEFINITION OF DONE WORKFLOW
      
      Follow this process for all development tasks using Kiro's spec structure:
      
      **Step 1: 📋 Ensure Spec Foundation Exists**
      - Verify `.kiro/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md` exists with EARS format requirements
      - Verify `.kiro/specs/{feature_name}/design.md` exists with architecture and components
      - Verify `.kiro/specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md` exists with numbered task breakdown
      - Review `.kiro/steering/` files for project standards and architecture guidelines
      
      **Step 2: 🎯 Identify Current Task**
      - Reference specific task from tasks.md file
      - Update task status to in progress with [o] in tasks.md
      - Ensure task references specific requirements from requirements.md
      - Check task has not already been completed even if not marked completed
      
      **Step 3: ✅ Write Tests First (TDD)**
      - Create comprehensive test coverage for the specific task
      - Include unit tests, integration tests, and error handling tests
      - Tests should validate requirements referenced in the task
      
      **Step 4: 🏗 Implement Minimal Code**
      - Build only what's needed to pass the tests for this specific task
      - Follow the design patterns outlined in design.md
      - Follow modular feature-based architecture from `.kiro/steering/structure.md`
      - Implement proper error handling and logging per `.kiro/steering/quality.md`
      
      I will NOT proceed beyond Step 4 until Steps 1-3 are complete.

  - type: react
    event: "implementation_complete"
    priority: critical

      # COMPLETE KIRO DEFINITION OF DONE
      
      After implementation:
      
      **Step 5: 🧪 Verify All Tests Pass**
      - Run all tests (unit, integration, end-to-end)
      - Ensure no regressions in existing functionality
      - Verify error handling works as designed
      
      **Step 6: 📚 Update Documentation**
      - Update any relevant README
      - Update relex all tasks that have been completed @000-definition-of-done.mdc @00-relentless-mode-rule.mdc vant specs files in `.kiro/specs/`
      - Update API documentation if applicable
      - Add code comments for complex logic
      - Update steering files in `.kiro/steering/` if patterns changed
      
      **Step 7: 📌 Update Task Status**
      - Mark current task as completed with [x] in tasks.md
      - Update tasks.md with any implementation notes
      - Verify task requirements are fully satisfied
      
      **Step 8: 🔄 Prepare for Next Task**
      - Commit changes with conventional commit format
      - Identify next task in tasks.md 
      - Continue on to next task and repeat the process
      - Keep going until all tasks are completed

  - type: reject
    conditions:
      - pattern: "complete|done"
      - missing: "all_steps_completed"
    message: |
      🚫 **KIRO DEFINITION OF DONE NOT MET**
      
      Cannot mark as complete until all steps are verified:
      1. Spec foundation exists (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md) and steering reviewed
      2. Current task identified and marked in_progress
      3. Tests written first (TDD approach)
      4. Minimal implementation completed following steering guidelines
      5. All tests passing
      6. Documentation updated
      7. Task status updated to completed
      8. Changes committed
      
      Please complete missing steps following Kiro's spec workflow.

examples:
  - input: "Implement authentication feature"
    output: "Starting Kiro DoD: First verify spec exists at .kiro/specs/authentication/"
  - input: "Mark task as done without tests"
    output: "Reject: Kiro DoD not met - TDD requires tests before implementation."
