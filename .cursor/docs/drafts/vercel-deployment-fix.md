# Vercel Deployment Fix - Client-Side Application Serving

## üìã PHASE ONE
### Brief
Fix Vercel deployment to properly serve the client-side React application instead of displaying compiled server-side TypeScript code.

### Core Idea
The current Vercel deployment is serving the compiled server-side TypeScript code (index.js) instead of the built client-side React application. This happens because Vercel doesn't have proper configuration to distinguish between server and client builds, and is defaulting to serving the main entry point which points to the server code. We need to configure Vercel to serve the static client build files and set up proper routing.

### Prompt
Fix the Vercel deployment configuration to properly serve the client-side React application. The build process is working correctly (both server and client builds complete successfully), but Vercel is serving the compiled server-side TypeScript code instead of the built client-side React application. Create a vercel.json configuration file that tells Vercel to serve the static client build files from dist/web/client and handle client-side routing properly.

## üèóÔ∏è PHASE TWO
### 1. User Stories
- **1.1** **As a developer**, I want the Vercel deployment to serve the React application so that users can access the UI instead of seeing compiled TypeScript code
- **1.2** **As a user**, I want to see the NeutralApp interface when visiting the deployed URL so that I can interact with the application
- **1.3** **As a developer**, I want proper client-side routing to work in production so that navigation between pages functions correctly

### 2. Technical Requirements
- **2.1** **Vercel Configuration**: Create vercel.json to specify static file serving and routing rules
- **2.2** **Build Output**: Ensure client build files are properly served from dist/web/client directory
- **2.3** **Client-Side Routing**: Configure SPA fallback for React Router to handle client-side navigation
- **2.4** **API Routing**: Set up proper API routes if server-side functionality is needed

### 3. Tasks
- [ ] **3.1.1** Create vercel.json configuration file in project root
- [ ] **3.1.2** Configure static file serving from dist/web/client directory
- [ ] **3.2.1** Set up SPA fallback routing for client-side navigation
- [ ] **3.2.2** Configure proper headers for static assets
- [ ] **3.3.1** Test deployment with new configuration
- [ ] **3.3.2** Verify client-side routing works correctly

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **4.1** WHEN visiting the deployed URL THEN the React application UI SHALL be displayed instead of TypeScript code
- [ ] **4.2** WHEN navigating between pages THEN client-side routing SHALL work without page reloads
- [ ] **4.3** WHEN accessing static assets THEN CSS and JS files SHALL load correctly
- [ ] **4.4** WHEN refreshing the page on any route THEN the application SHALL load properly

### 5. Dependencies
- [ ] **5.1** Vercel CLI and deployment pipeline must be functional
- [ ] **5.2** Client build process must complete successfully (already working)
- [ ] **5.3** React Router must be properly configured in the application

### 6. Success Metrics
- **Performance**: Client application loads within 3 seconds
- **Reliability**: 100% of page loads show the React UI instead of TypeScript code
- **User Experience**: Smooth navigation between all application pages

## üèóÔ∏è PHASE THREE (Complex Features Only)
### 7. Technical Design
**Steering Integration:** Reference to .kiro/steering/ deployment patterns

**Architecture:**
- Static file serving from dist/web/client directory
- SPA fallback routing for all non-API routes
- Proper asset optimization and caching headers

**Technology Stack:**
- Vercel platform for static hosting
- React Router for client-side navigation
- Vite for client-side build optimization

**Integration Points:**
- Vercel deployment pipeline
- Existing build scripts in package.json
- Client-side React application structure

**Security Considerations:**
- Proper CSP headers for static assets
- Secure routing configuration

**Migration Plan:**
- Add vercel.json configuration
- Test deployment in staging environment
- Deploy to production with monitoring
- Verify all routes and functionality work correctly
