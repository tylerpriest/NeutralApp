# What is the purpose here ? 

Fix all TODO and Tests not passing


Once this is fixed and UI is modernised ... then get the app working ... then go from there ... build a few plugins

What is all the stuff in the GUI that is not needed ?

make sure the plugin section works like I want and that I can have a github repository as the marketplace 

Does app run? 
Log in does not work
Box showing demo login details not appearing


What are my priorities
1. Plugin Manager working
2. TODO's completed*
3. UI modernised
4. UX / CX modernised*
5. Login not required
6. Pack of Plugins to recreate Narratoo?*



X. Modular by feature audit and refactor
X. Steering rules audit and refactor


Sidebar like Plex where you can pick and choose what shows 
Settings for the Plugin / Packs different from Settings for Neutral App ?

And some way to have multiple 'app' (plugin packs) running in the same env ? 
So its a book reader and also a Stremio ?
