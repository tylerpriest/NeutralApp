Fix all TODO and Tests not passing

What is the purpose here ? 

Once this is fixed and UI is modernised ... then get the app working ... then go from there ... build a few plugins

What is all the stuff in the GUI that is not needed ?

make sure the plugin section works like I want and that I can have a github repository as the marketplace 

Does app run? 
Log in does not work
Box showing demo login details not appearing
