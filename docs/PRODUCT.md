# NeutralApp

## App Name: NeutralApp
**Tagline / One-liner:** Domain-agnostic, ultra-modular application shell with plugin-first architecture

**What It Does:** NeutralApp provides a minimal, secure foundation for any user-facing application through a robust plugin system. The core delivers only essential services (authentication, settings, admin dashboard, plugin management, UI shell) while all business logic lives in isolated, sandboxed plugins.

***Plugin Ecosystem Approach**

    **Core Concept:** Three-tier system (Bundled, Official, Community) with individual plugins and packs in each tier

    **User Experience:**
    - **Bundled Tier**: Pre-installed plugins ready to enable (immediate value)
    - **Official Tier**: Curated, verified plugins from NeutralApp team (quality guarantee)
    - **Community Tier**: Community-contributed plugins and packs (innovation)

    **Technical Foundation:**
    - Beautiful GUI marketplace interface
    - GitHub-based backend registry for plugin metadata
    - Support for both individual plugins and curated packs
    - Unified installation and management experience
