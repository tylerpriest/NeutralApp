# Deployment Verification and Rollback Procedures

## Overview

This document describes the deployment verification and rollback procedures for NeutralApp. These procedures ensure that deployments are successful and provide a reliable way to rollback to previous versions if issues arise.

## Deployment Verification

### Purpose
Deployment verification ensures that:
- The application is healthy and responding
- All critical endpoints are accessible
- Performance meets acceptable thresholds
- Security configurations are properly set
- Infrastructure components are functioning correctly

### Verification Scripts

#### 1. Main Verification Script
```bash
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh [staging|production]
```

**Checks performed:**
- Application health endpoint (`/health`)
- Database connectivity
- API endpoints (`/api/health`, `/api/status`)
- Performance metrics (response time, throughput)
- SSL certificate validity and expiration
- DNS resolution
- Load balancer status
- CDN status

#### 2. Performance Verification
```bash
./scripts/verify-performance.sh [staging|production]
```

**Checks performed:**
- Response time measurements
- Throughput testing
- Error rate monitoring
- Load testing (optional)

#### 3. Security Verification
```bash
./scripts/verify-security.sh [staging|production]
```

**Checks performed:**
- SSL certificate configuration
- Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- CORS policy configuration
- Content Security Policy
- HSTS headers

#### 4. Smoke Tests
```bash
./scripts/smoke-tests.sh [staging|production]
```

**Tests performed:**
- Critical path testing
- User workflow validation
- Authentication endpoint testing
- Dashboard loading verification
- Plugin functionality testing
- Settings access verification

### Configuration

The verification process is configured through `config/deployment-verification.json`:

```json
{
  "verification": {
    "healthCheckTimeout": 30,
    "maxResponseTime": 500,
    "minSuccessRate": 0.95,
    "retryAttempts": 3,
    "retryDelay": 5
  }
}
```

### Environment-Specific Settings

#### Staging Environment
- Verification timeout: 30 seconds
- Retry attempts: 2
- Auto-rollback: Enabled
- Performance thresholds: Lower (for faster feedback)

#### Production Environment
- Verification timeout: 60 seconds
- Retry attempts: 3
- Auto-rollback: Enabled
- Performance thresholds: Higher (for stability)

## Rollback Procedures

### Purpose
Rollback procedures provide a reliable way to:
- Revert to a previous working version
- Minimize downtime during issues
- Maintain system stability
- Provide audit trail of changes

### Rollback Script
```bash
./scripts/rollback.sh [staging|production] [version]
```

### Rollback Process

1. **Version Validation**
   - Verify the target version exists
   - Check version compatibility
   - Validate rollback prerequisites

2. **Pre-Rollback Backup**
   - Create backup of current version
   - Store deployment metadata
   - Log rollback initiation

3. **Rollback Execution**
   - Stop current deployment
   - Deploy previous version
   - Update routing/load balancer
   - Verify deployment success

4. **Post-Rollback Verification**
   - Health checks
   - Smoke tests
   - Performance verification
   - Notification to stakeholders

### Version Management

#### Available Versions
```bash
./scripts/rollback.sh [environment] --list
```

#### Version Information
- Version tags: `v1.0.0`, `v1.0.1`, etc.
- Latest version: `latest`
- Previous version: `previous`
- Stable version: `stable`

### Rollback Configuration

```json
{
  "rollback": {
    "autoRollback": true,
    "maxRollbackAttempts": 3,
    "rollbackThreshold": 0.8,
    "versionManagement": {
      "keepVersions": 5,
      "cleanupOldVersions": true,
      "backupBeforeRollback": true
    }
  }
}
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The deployment verification is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Verify deployment
  run: ./scripts/verify-deployment.sh ${{ env.ENVIRONMENT }}

- name: Run smoke tests
  run: ./scripts/smoke-tests.sh ${{ env.ENVIRONMENT }}

- name: Performance verification
  run: ./scripts/verify-performance.sh ${{ env.ENVIRONMENT }}

- name: Security verification
  run: ./scripts/verify-security.sh ${{ env.ENVIRONMENT }}
```

### Auto-Rollback

If verification fails, the system can automatically rollback:

```yaml
- name: Auto-rollback on failure
  if: failure()
  run: ./scripts/rollback.sh ${{ env.ENVIRONMENT }} previous
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Deployment Monitoring

The system monitors deployment health through:
- Real-time health checks
- Performance metrics
- Error rate monitoring
- Infrastructure status

### Alerting Channels

1. **Email Notifications**
   - Deployment success/failure
   - Rollback notifications
   - Performance alerts

2. **Slack Notifications**
   - Real-time deployment status
   - Rollback alerts
   - Performance warnings

3. **Webhook Notifications**
   - Integration with external systems
   - Custom notification formats
   - Automated responses

### Alert Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate rollback required
- **Error**: Manual intervention needed
- **Warning**: Monitor closely
- **Info**: Status updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Verification Timeout
**Symptoms:** Verification scripts timeout
**Solutions:**
- Check network connectivity
- Verify endpoint accessibility
- Increase timeout values
- Check firewall settings

#### 2. Performance Degradation
**Symptoms:** Response times exceed thresholds
**Solutions:**
- Check server resources
- Monitor database performance
- Review recent changes
- Scale infrastructure if needed

#### 3. Rollback Failures
**Symptoms:** Rollback process fails
**Solutions:**
- Verify version availability
- Check deployment permissions
- Review rollback logs
- Manual intervention if needed

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check verification configuration
cat config/deployment-verification.json

# Test individual verification components
curl -I https://neutralapp.com/health
curl -I https://neutralapp.com/api/health

# Check SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect neutralapp.com:443 -servername neutralapp.com

# Test performance
./scripts/verify-performance.sh production

# Run smoke tests with verbose output
./scripts/smoke-tests.sh production --verbose
```

## Best Practices

4. **Protect verification credentials** and secrets
5. **Regular security reviews** of verification procedures

### Rollback Security

1. **Secure rollback procedures** with proper access controls
