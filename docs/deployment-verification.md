# Deployment Verification

## Overview

This document outlines the deployment verification process for NeutralApp, ensuring that deployments are successful and the application is functioning correctly in production environments.

## Deployment Verification Process

### Pre-Deployment Checks

1. **Code Quality Gates**
   - All tests passing (>80% pass rate)
   - TypeScript compilation successful
   - No critical linting errors
   - Security scan passed

2. **Build Verification**
   - Production build completes successfully
   - All assets are properly bundled
   - Environment variables are correctly configured

### Deployment Steps

1. **Staging Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment first
   - Run smoke tests
   - Verify all critical functionality

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy to production environment
   - Monitor deployment logs
   - Verify application health

### Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Health Checks**
   - Application responds to health check endpoints
   - Database connections are established
   - External service integrations are working

2. **Functional Testing**
   - Authentication flow works correctly
   - Plugin system is operational
   - Settings and admin features are accessible

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Page load times are within acceptable limits
   - API response times are optimal
   - Resource usage is within expected ranges

## Rollback Procedures

If deployment verification fails, follow the rollback procedures outlined in the rollback documentation.

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Set up monitoring for key metrics
- Configure alerts for critical failures
- Monitor error rates and performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check TypeScript compilation errors
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Review build logs for specific errors

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Verify all required environment variables are set
   - Check configuration file syntax
   - Validate database connection strings

3. **Service Startup Issues**
   - Check application logs for startup errors
   - Verify port availability
   - Review service dependencies

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor resource usage during deployment
   - Check for memory leaks or high CPU usage
   - Review database query performance

### Debugging Steps

1. **Log Analysis**
   - Review application logs for errors
   - Check system logs for infrastructure issues
   - Monitor network connectivity

2. **Health Check Verification**
   - Test individual health check endpoints
   - Verify service dependencies
   - Check external service connectivity

3. **Rollback Preparation**
   - Identify the last known good deployment
   - Prepare rollback scripts
   - Notify stakeholders of potential issues
