# CI/CD Setup Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) setup for the NeutralApp project. The CI/CD pipeline ensures code quality, runs comprehensive tests, and automates deployment processes.

## ✅ Verification Status

**Last Updated**: July 27, 2024  
**Status**: ✅ **Verified and Accurate**  
**Workflow Files**: 
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main CI pipeline with quality gates and multi-node testing
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Deployment pipeline for staging and production
- `.github/workflows/ci-local.yml` - Simplified CI for local testing
- `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` - Docker image building pipeline

## Architecture

### CI/CD Pipeline Components

1. **Quality Gates** - Enforces minimum quality standards
2. **Test Suite** - Runs all tests (unit, integration, e2e)
3. **Build Process** - Compiles and packages the application
4. **Security Audit** - Checks for vulnerabilities
5. **Code Quality** - Linting and type checking
6. **Deployment** - Automated deployment to staging/production

## Workflows

### 1. Continuous Integration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches

**Jobs:**
- **Quality Gates**: TypeScript compilation, test pass rate validation (80% minimum)
- **Test Suite**: Unified test execution across Node.js versions 16, 18, 20
- **Build**: Application compilation and packaging
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning with npm audit
- **Lint**: Code quality checks with ESLint
- **Performance**: Performance testing with Playwright
- **Visual Regression**: UI consistency testing
- **Integration Summary**: Comprehensive report generation

### 2. Continuous Deployment (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Successful completion of CI workflow
- Only on `main` and `develop` branches

**Jobs:**
- **Staging Deployment**: Deploy to staging environment (develop branch)
- **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production environment (main branch)
- **Health Checks**: Post-deployment health verification
- **Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality testing after deployment
- **Performance Verification**: Performance metrics validation
- **Security Verification**: Security configuration checks

### 3. Local CI Test (`.github/workflows/ci-local.yml`)

**Purpose:** Simplified CI workflow for local testing and development

**Features:**
- Manual trigger capability (workflow_dispatch)
- Essential quality gates (TypeScript compilation, test pass rate)
- Basic test suite execution
- Build verification
- Reduced timeout and resource usage

## Quality Gates

### 1. TypeScript Compilation Gate
- **Requirement**: All TypeScript must compile without errors
- **Validation**: `npm run build`
- **Failure Action**: Pipeline stops immediately

### 2. Test Pass Rate Gate
- **Requirement**: Minimum 80% test pass rate
- **Validation**: Jest test execution with pass rate calculation
- **Failure Action**: Pipeline stops immediately

### 3. Security Gate
- **Requirement**: No high or critical vulnerabilities
- **Validation**: `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`
- **Failure Action**: Warning logged, pipeline continues

### 4. Code Quality Gate
- **Requirement**: ESLint passes, TypeScript types valid
- **Validation**: `npm run lint` and `tsc --noEmit`
- **Failure Action**: Pipeline stops immediately

## Test Suite

### Unified Test Reporting

The project uses a unified test reporting system that combines results from:
- **Jest**: Unit and integration tests
- **Playwright**: End-to-end and visual regression tests

**Features:**
- HTML and JSON report generation
- Test categorization (unit, integration, e2e)
- Pass rate tracking
- Duration monitoring
- Error aggregation

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component and function testing
2. **Integration Tests**: API and service integration testing
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Full application workflow testing
4. **Visual Regression Tests**: UI consistency validation
5. **Performance Tests**: Application performance validation

## Deployment Strategy

### Staging Environment
- **Branch**: `develop`
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing
- **Automation**: Automatic deployment on successful CI
- **Validation**: Smoke tests and basic health checks

### Production Environment
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Purpose**: Live application
- **Automation**: Automatic deployment on successful CI
- **Validation**: Comprehensive health checks and performance tests

### Rollback Strategy
- **Trigger**: Deployment failure or critical issues
- **Action**: Automatic rollback to previous stable version
- **Notification**: Immediate alert to development team

## Usage

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Run all tests with unified reporting
npm run test:unified

# Run specific test types
npm test                    # Jest tests only
npm run test:e2e           # Playwright tests only
npm run test:coverage      # Jest with coverage
```

### Manual CI Trigger

1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Local CI Test" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch and click "Run workflow"

### Viewing Test Results

1. **Unified HTML Report**: `test-results/unified-report.html`
2. **Jest Results**: `test-results/jest-results.json`
3. **Playwright Results**: `playwright-report/`
4. **GitHub Actions**: Check the Actions tab for detailed logs

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# CI Environment
CI=true
NODE_ENV=test

# Deployment Environments
NODE_ENV=staging    # For staging deployment
NODE_ENV=production # For production deployment
```

### Node.js Versions

The CI pipeline tests against multiple Node.js versions:
- Node.js 16
- Node.js 18 (primary)
- Node.js 20

### Timeouts

- **Quality Gates**: 10 minutes
- **Test Suite**: 30 minutes
- **Build**: 15 minutes
- **Security**: 10 minutes
- **Lint**: 10 minutes
- **Deployment**: 20-30 minutes

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Success Metrics
- Test pass rate ≥ 80%
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- All quality gates passing
- Successful deployment completion

### Failure Alerts
- Quality gate failures
- Test suite failures
- Build failures
- Deployment failures

- Unified test reports
- Security audit reports
- Deployment status notifications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Failures**
   - Check test logs in GitHub Actions
   - Review unified test report
   - Verify test environment setup

2. **Build Failures**
   - Check TypeScript compilation errors
   - Verify dependency installation
   - Review build configuration

3. **Deployment Failures**
   - Check deployment logs

npm audit

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Best Practices
