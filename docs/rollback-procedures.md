# Rollback Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the rollback procedures for NeutralApp deployments, ensuring that we can quickly revert to a previous stable version if issues are encountered in production.

## Rollback Process

### When to Rollback

- Critical functionality is broken
- Performance degradation beyond acceptable limits
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
- Data integrity issues are identified
- User experience is significantly impacted

### Pre-Rollback Checklist

1. **Assessment**
   - Identify the specific issues
   - Determine the scope of the problem
   - Assess impact on users and business

2. **Communication**
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Inform users if necessary
   - Prepare rollback announcement

3. **Preparation**
   - Identify the target rollback version
   - Verify the rollback version is stable
   - Prepare rollback scripts and procedures

### Rollback Steps

1. **Database Rollback**
   - Backup current database state
   - Rollback database migrations if necessary
   - Verify data integrity

2. **Application Rollback**
   - Deploy previous stable version
   - Update environment variables if needed
   - Restart application services

3. **Infrastructure Rollback**
   - Rollback infrastructure changes
   - Update DNS or load balancer configurations
   - Verify all services are running

### Post-Rollback Verification

1. **Health Checks**
   - Verify application is responding
   - Check all critical endpoints
   - Monitor error rates

2. **Functional Testing**
   - Test core functionality
   - Verify user workflows
   - Check integration points

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor response times
   - Check resource usage
   - Verify user experience

## Version Management

### Version Tagging

- Tag all releases with semantic versioning
- Maintain a changelog of all changes
- Document breaking changes

### Rollback Targets

- Keep multiple stable versions available
- Maintain deployment artifacts
- Document version compatibility

### Automated Rollback

- Implement automated rollback triggers
- Set up monitoring alerts
- Configure rollback thresholds

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Incident Response

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Stop the deployment immediately
   - Notify the on-call engineer
   - Assess the severity of the issue

2. **Emergency Rollback**
   - Execute emergency rollback procedures
   - Deploy the last known good version
   - Verify critical functionality

3. **Communication Protocol**
   - Notify all stakeholders immediately
   - Update status pages
   - Communicate with users
