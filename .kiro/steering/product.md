# Product Vision

NeutralApp is a domain-agnostic, ultra-modular application shell designed as a foundation for any user-facing application. The core provides only essentials while all other features are built as plugins.

## Vision Statement

To create the most flexible, maintainable, and developer-friendly application foundation that enables rapid development of any user-facing application while maintaining security, performance, and reliability.

## Key Principles

- **Plugin-First Architecture**: All business logic lives in plugins, core remains minimal
- **Sandboxed Environment**: Each plugin operates in isolation with secure API access
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Graceful degradation when plugins fail, core always available
- **Developer & AI-Friendly**: Structured APIs, comprehensive logging, automated error handling

## Target Users

- **Developers**: Seeking solid foundation without reinventing infrastructure
- **AI Agents**: Needing clear APIs and structured error handling
- **Plugin Authors**: Creating reusable components and features
- **End Users**: Wanting flexible, maintainable applications
