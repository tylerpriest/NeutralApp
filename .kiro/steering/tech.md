# Technology Stack

## Status
This project is in early planning phase. Tech stack decisions are pending based on implementation requirements.

## Recommended Considerations

### Frontend Framework Options
- Modern web framework with strong plugin architecture support
- Component-based architecture for UI modularity
- Strong TypeScript support for developer experience
- Robust routing system for plugin integration

### Backend Architecture
- RESTful API design for plugin communication
- Secure authentication system (JWT/OAuth)
- Database abstraction layer for plugin data isolation
- Event-driven architecture for inter-plugin communication

### Plugin System Requirements
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Dynamic loading/unloading capabilities
- Secure API boundaries
- Version management and dependency resolution

### Development Tools
- Automated testing framework (unit, integration, e2e)
- Code linting and formatting standards
- Build system with plugin hot-reloading
- Comprehensive logging and debugging tools

## Common Commands (TBD)
Once tech stack is selected, this section will include:
- Build and development server commands
- Testing and linting commands
- Plugin development and packaging
- Deployment and production builds

## Architecture Priorities
- Security-first plugin isolation
- Performance with many plugins
- Developer-friendly APIs
- Comprehensive error handling
- Automated testing integration
