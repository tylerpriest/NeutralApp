# Technology Stack

## Status
This project is in early planning phase. Tech stack decisions are pending based on implementation requirements.

## Recommended Considerations

### Frontend Framework Options
- Modern web framework with strong plugin architecture support
- Component-based architecture for UI modularity
- Strong TypeScript support for developer experience
- Robust routing system for plugin integration

### Backend Architecture
- RESTful API design for plugin communication
- Secure authentication system (JWT/OAuth)
- Database abstraction layer for plugin data isolation
- Event-driven architecture for inter-plugin communication

### Plugin System Requirements
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Dynamic loading/unloading capabilities
- Secure API boundaries
- Version management and dependency resolution

### Development Tools
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive suite supporting unit, integration, and headless e2e tests
- **Error Logging**: Structured logging system with dashboard integration (no console copy-pasting)
- **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, and quality gates preventing incomplete code
- **Build System**: Plugin hot-reloading with automated test execution
- **Debugging Tools**: Real-time error monitoring and traceability systems

## Common Commands (TBD)
Once tech stack is selected, this section will include:
- Build and development server commands
- Testing and linting commands
- Plugin development and packaging
- Deployment and production builds

## Architecture Priorities
- Security-first plugin isolation
- Performance with many plugins
- Developer-friendly APIs
- **Complete error capture and traceability**
- **Real-world testing with headless e2e scenarios**
- **Dashboard-based error monitoring (no console debugging)**
- Automated testing integration with quality gates
