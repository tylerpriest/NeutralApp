# UX/CX Modernization Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the comprehensive User Experience (UX) and Customer Experience (CX) modernization needed to transform NeutralApp from a functional application into an intuitive, delightful, and user-centered platform. While the UI modernization spec focuses on visual styling and component modernization, this spec concentrates on user flows, interaction patterns, usability improvements, onboarding experiences, and overall user satisfaction. The goal is to create an application that users love to use and that reduces friction at every touchpoint.
