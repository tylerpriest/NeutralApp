## üî¥ TODO

### React Component Implementation
- [ ] Fix React app mounting and component rendering
- [ ] Implement missing UI elements for UAT tests
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries and loading states
- [ ] Implement proper routing for dashboard navigation

### Additional UAT Test Scenarios
- [x] **Create UAT tests for book reading workflow** - Created comprehensive book-reading.spec.ts with 13 test scenarios
- [ ] Create UAT tests for plugin installation workflow
- [ ] Create UAT tests for user authentication flow
- [ ] Create UAT tests for settings management
- [ ] Create UAT tests for admin functionality

### Test Infrastructure Enhancements
- [ ] Add visual regression testing
- [ ] Implement performance testing with Lighthouse CI
- [ ] Add accessibility testing (WCAG compliance)
- [ ] Create test data factories for consistent test data

### Documentation
- [ ] Create developer guide for writing UAT tests
- [ ] Document the SBE/ATDD workflow
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common test issues
- [ ] Document the real-time progress system

## üü¢ COMPLETED

### Core Infrastructure Setup
- [x] **Fixed Vite build configuration** - Resolved empty chunk error in vite.config.ts
- [x] **Implemented real-time test progress display** - Created scripts/run-uat-with-progress.ts and scripts/run-single-uat-test.ts
- [x] **Fixed static file serving** - Corrected path in WebServer.ts from `../../client` to `../client`
- [x] **Resolved web server conflicts** - Disabled Playwright webServer configuration to prevent port conflicts
- [x] **Fixed CSP issues** - Disabled CSP in development to prevent SSL errors
- [x] **Created comprehensive debug tests** - Added tests/uat/debug-*.spec.ts for troubleshooting

### UAT Test Framework
- [x] **Created UAT test structure** - Set up tests/uat/ directory with proper organization
- [x] **Implemented executable specifications** - Created basic-navigation.spec.ts following SBE/ATDD
- [x] **Added business value tests** - Created dashboard-value.spec.ts for business outcomes
- [x] **Created system behavior specs** - Added system-behavior.spec.ts for general system behavior
- [x] **Added book reading tests** - Created comprehensive book-reading.spec.ts with 13 scenarios
- [x] **Added Gherkin acceptance criteria** - Created plugin-management.feature for BDD

### Quality Gates Integration
- [x] **Enhanced quality gates** - Added UAT pass rate, business value delivery, and executable spec coverage
- [x] **Updated package.json scripts** - Added test:uat, test:uat:critical, test:business, etc.
- [x] **Integrated with unified test runner** - Updated scripts/run-unified-tests.ts

### UI Components for Testing
- [x] **Added navigation elements to WelcomeScreen** - Added data-testid attributes for browse-plugins, settings-link, admin-link
- [x] **Fixed AdminPage title** - Changed from "Admin Panel" to "Admin" to match UAT expectations
- [x] **Verified page titles** - Confirmed SettingsPage and PluginManagerPage have correct titles

### Test Execution Environment
- [x] **Fixed Playwright configuration** - Updated testDir, testMatch, and testIgnore patterns
- [x] **Resolved test discovery issues** - Fixed .story.ts vs .spec.ts naming conventions
- [x] **Implemented real-time progress parsing** - Added custom output processing for better UX
- [x] **Created single test runner** - Added npm run test:uat:single for focused testing

### Server Infrastructure
- [x] **Fixed Express static file serving** - Corrected path resolution for client files
- [x] **Resolved catch-all route conflicts** - Fixed static file interception by catch-all route
- [x] **Implemented proper error handling** - Added graceful error handling for missing files
- [x] **Fixed port conflict resolution** - Implemented proper process management

## Key Achievements

### Real-Time Progress System
- ‚úÖ **Custom progress parsing** - Parses Playwright output to show meaningful progress
- ‚úÖ **User-friendly messages** - Shows "üîÑ Discovering UAT tests...", "üìÅ Processing...", etc.
- ‚úÖ **Immediate feedback** - No more silent test execution
- ‚úÖ **Error visibility** - Clear error messages with context

### SBE/ATDD Implementation
- ‚úÖ **Examples First approach** - UAT tests written before implementation
- ‚úÖ **Executable specifications** - Tests serve as living documentation
- ‚úÖ **Business value focus** - Tests validate user goals, not implementation details
- ‚úÖ **Value-driven testing** - Every test validates real user value

### Infrastructure Resilience
- ‚úÖ **Robust error handling** - Graceful handling of server conflicts and file issues
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive debugging** - Multiple debug test types for different scenarios
- ‚úÖ **Process management** - Proper cleanup and restart procedures
- ‚úÖ **Configuration management** - Environment-specific settings

---

## Next Steps

1. **Fix React component rendering** - The main blocker preventing UAT tests from passing
2. **Implement missing UI elements** - Add the elements that UAT tests expect
3. **Expand test coverage** - Add more UAT scenarios for comprehensive coverage
4. **Performance optimization** - Ensure tests run efficiently in CI/CD

---

## Technical Debt

- **React app mounting issue** - Components not rendering despite successful mounting
- **Static file serving complexity** - Path resolution could be simplified
- **Process management** - Could benefit from more robust process handling
- **Error reporting** - Could be enhanced with more detailed error context

---

## Metrics

- **UAT Tests Created**: 5 (basic-navigation, dashboard-value, system-behavior, book-reading, plugin-management)
- **Debug Tests Created**: 3 (debug-navigation, debug-console, debug-react)
- **Real-time Progress**: ‚úÖ Working
- **Static File Serving**: ‚úÖ Working
- **Server Infrastructure**: ‚úÖ Working
- **Test Discovery**: ‚úÖ Working
- **React App Loading**: ‚úÖ Working
- **React Component Rendering**: ‚ùå Needs fixing
