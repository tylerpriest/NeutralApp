# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The plugin widget integration feature is functionally working but has critical test failures, quality issues, and production readiness problems that must be addressed before deployment. This includes broken settings integration, incorrect test expectations, API response mismatches, excessive TODO comments, and console.log statements in production code. These issues prevent the feature from being production-ready and could cause runtime failures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to pass so that I can confidently deploy the plugin widget integration feature

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all tests are run THEN the test suite SHALL have >95% pass rate
2. WHEN critical functionality tests are executed THEN they SHALL all pass without errors
3. WHEN the test suite completes THEN it SHALL finish within 60 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want plugin settings to work properly so that I can configure plugin behavior

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plugin settings are registered THEN they SHALL be properly stored and retrievable
2. WHEN I modify plugin settings THEN the changes SHALL persist across sessions
3. WHEN plugin settings are initialized THEN default values SHALL be correctly applied
4. WHEN multiple plugins register settings THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want plugin widgets to register correctly so that the system operates reliably

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plugins are enabled THEN widgets SHALL be registered exactly once
2. WHEN multiple plugins are activated concurrently THEN widget registration SHALL handle race conditions properly
3. WHEN plugin activation fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without affecting other plugins

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want API endpoints to return consistent response structures so that frontend integration works correctly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL return expected response structures
2. WHEN plugin enable/disable operations are performed THEN the API SHALL return standardized responses
3. WHEN API integration tests are run THEN they SHALL match actual response formats

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clean production code so that I can maintain the system without debugging noise

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN production code is deployed THEN it SHALL contain no TODO comments
2. WHEN production code is executed THEN it SHALL not output console.log statements
3. WHEN code quality checks are run THEN they SHALL pass all standards
4. WHEN static assets are served THEN the infrastructure SHALL work reliably

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling so that the system degrades gracefully

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN JWT service SHALL handle them properly
2. WHEN component errors occur THEN ErrorBoundary SHALL catch and display them appropriately
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN WebServer SHALL handle them without crashing
4. WHEN performance monitoring runs THEN it SHALL collect accurate metrics
