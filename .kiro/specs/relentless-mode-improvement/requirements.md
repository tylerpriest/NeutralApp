# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Relentless Mode rule needs updating to ensure continuous progress toward PRODUCTION-READY applications with proper quality gates. Additionally, we need a systematic multi-perspective approach for solving persistent technical problems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Production-Ready Relentless Mode Rule

**User Story:** As a developer using AI assistance, I want Relentless Mode to ensure continuous progress toward production-ready applications with enforced quality gates, so that I build fast AND build right without bypassing quality for speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the rule is applied THEN it SHALL auto-approve actions and proceed without waiting
2. WHEN TypeScript compilation fails THEN it SHALL stop and fix compilation before proceeding
3. WHEN core test suite drops below 80% pass rate THEN it SHALL stop and fix tests before proceeding
4. WHEN critical services lack working interfaces THEN it SHALL stop and fix interfaces before proceeding
5. WHEN all quality gates pass THEN it SHALL proceed relentlessly to the next task
6. WHEN quality gates fail THEN it SHALL stop and fix foundation before proceeding

### Requirement 2: Multi-Perspective Problem Analysis Steering Rule

**User Story:** As a developer stuck on technical problems, I want a 5-7 perspective analysis framework that examines issues from different professional viewpoints, so that I can step back, analyze systematically, and synthesize the best path forward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the same quality gate fails 3+ times in a row THEN the steering rule SHALL trigger multi-perspective analysis
2. WHEN a user manually requests "#multi-perspective-analysis" THEN the steering rule SHALL be included
3. WHEN analyzing THEN it SHALL examine from PM perspective (business impact and priorities)
4. WHEN analyzing THEN it SHALL examine from Senior Dev perspective (root causes and architecture)
5. WHEN analyzing THEN it SHALL examine from Code Monkey perspective (specific fixes and implementation)
6. WHEN analyzing THEN it SHALL examine from QA Tester perspective (what's breaking and test categories)
7. WHEN analyzing THEN it SHALL examine from DevOps perspective (build and deployment impact)
8. WHEN analyzing THEN it SHALL examine from Tech Lead perspective (strategic approach and trade-offs)
9. WHEN analyzing THEN it SHALL examine from Architect perspective (meta solutions and patterns)
10. WHEN all perspectives are gathered THEN it SHALL synthesize the best path forward
