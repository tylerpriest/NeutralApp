# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Update Definition of Done with production-ready quality gates
  - [ ] 1.1 Update definition of done rule file
    - Update `.cursor/rules/000-definition-of-done.mdc` to include three quality gates
    - Add TypeScript compilation requirement (all compilation must succeed)
    - Add core test suite requirement (>80% pass rate)
    - Add critical services requirement (working interfaces)
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 2. Transform Relentless Mode from "move forward no matter what" to "build PRODUCTION-READY applications"
  - [ ] 2.1 Rewrite core relentless mode philosophy
    - Update `.cursor/rules/00-relentless-mode-rule.mdc` to change fundamental approach
    - Replace "move forward at all costs" with "relentless building of PRODUCTION-READY applications"
    - Add "build fast AND build right" principle without bypassing quality for speed
    - Emphasize auto-approval and continuous progress WITH quality enforcement
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 1.6_

  - [ ] 2.2 Implement quality gate enforcement in relentless mode
    - Add three quality gates that must pass before proceeding: TypeScript compilation, >80% core test pass rate, working critical service interfaces
    - Add "stop and fix foundation" behavior when quality gates fail
    - Add "proceed relentlessly" behavior when all quality gates pass
    - Ensure rule maintains speed and momentum while enforcing production readiness
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

  - [ ] 2.3 Add quality gate failure tracking and escalation
    - Add logic to track consecutive failures of the same quality gate
    - Add automatic trigger for multi-perspective analysis after 3+ consecutive failures
    - Test that failure tracking works correctly and escalates appropriately
    - _Requirements: 2.1_

- [ ] 3. Create Multi-Perspective Problem Analysis steering rule
  - [ ] 3.1 Create new steering rule file
    - Create `.kiro/steering/multi-perspective-analysis.md` file
    - Configure as manual inclusion steering rule (inclusion: manual)
    - Add front-matter to enable "#multi-perspective-analysis" context key triggering
    - Add logic for automatic triggering after 3+ consecutive quality gate failures
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

  - [ ] 3.2 Define the 7-perspective analysis framework
    - Document PM perspective methodology (business impact and priorities)
    - Document Senior Dev perspective methodology (root causes and architecture)
    - Document Code Monkey perspective methodology (specific fixes and implementation)
    - Document QA Tester perspective methodology (what's breaking and test categories)
    - Document DevOps perspective methodology (build and deployment impact)
    - Document Tech Lead perspective methodology (strategic approach and trade-offs)
    - Document Architect perspective methodology (meta solutions and patterns)
    - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8_

  - [ ] 3.3 Add systematic analysis process guidance
    - Document step-by-step process for applying each perspective
    - Add guidance for stepping back from immediate problem
    - Add methodology for synthesizing insights into best path forward
    - Include structured format for analysis output
    - _Requirements: 2.9_

- [ ] 4. Test and validate the updated system
  - [ ] 4.1 Test updated definition of done and relentless mode integration
    - Create test scenarios with TypeScript compilation failures
    - Create test scenarios with core test suite failures below 80%
    - Create test scenarios with critical service interface failures
    - Verify rule stops and requires fixes in each failure scenario
    - Verify rule proceeds relentlessly when all gates pass
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6_

  - [ ] 4.2 Test multi-perspective analysis steering rule
    - Test conditional inclusion configuration works correctly
    - Verify all 7 perspectives are documented with clear methodologies
    - Test that analysis framework provides systematic problem-solving guidance
    - Verify synthesis process combines insights into actionable recommendations
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9_

  - [ ] 4.3 Integration testing of complete system
    - Test interaction between updated relentless mode rule and steering rule
    - Verify quality gates work with existing development workflow
    - Test that multi-perspective analysis can be triggered when needed
    - Validate that both rules work together without conflicts
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 1.6, 2.1, 2.9_
