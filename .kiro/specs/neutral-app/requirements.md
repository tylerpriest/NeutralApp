# Requirements Document

## Introduction

NeutralApp is a domain-agnostic, ultra-modular application shell designed to serve as the foundation for any kind of user-facing application. The system provides only essential core functionality (authentication, settings, admin dashboard, plugin management, and UI shell) while enabling all other features through a robust plugin architecture. The platform prioritizes developer and AI-agent friendliness through comprehensive error handling, automated testing, and clear API boundaries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely register, login, and maintain my session, so that I can access my personalized application experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and establish a secure session
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to login while preserving their intended destination
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL terminate the session and clear all authentication tokens
6. IF a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages without revealing system details

### Requirement 2: Plugin Management System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to install, configure, and manage plugins, so that I can customize my application with the features I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the plugin manager THEN the system SHALL display all available plugins with descriptions and ratings
2. WHEN a user installs a plugin THEN the system SHALL download, verify, and activate the plugin safely
3. WHEN a user enables a plugin THEN the system SHALL integrate the plugin's UI components and settings into the application
4. WHEN a user disables a plugin THEN the system SHALL remove the plugin's UI elements while preserving user data
5. WHEN a user uninstalls a plugin THEN the system SHALL remove all plugin files and optionally clean up user data
6. IF a plugin fails to load THEN the system SHALL continue operating and display an error message to the user
7. WHEN plugins have dependencies THEN the system SHALL resolve and install required dependencies automatically

### Requirement 3: User Settings and Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure my application preferences and plugin settings, so that I can personalize my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL display core application settings and installed plugin settings
2. WHEN a user modifies a setting THEN the system SHALL validate and persist the change immediately
3. WHEN a plugin is installed THEN the system SHALL automatically integrate the plugin's settings into the settings panel
4. WHEN a user resets settings THEN the system SHALL restore default values while confirming the action
5. IF settings become corrupted THEN the system SHALL fall back to default values and notify the user

### Requirement 4: Main Application Dashboard

**User Story:** As a user, I want a main dashboard that displays content and functionality from my installed plugins, so that I can access the features relevant to my specific application use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the main dashboard THEN the system SHALL display content and widgets provided by installed plugins
2. WHEN plugins register dashboard components THEN the system SHALL integrate them into the dashboard layout
3. WHEN no plugins are installed THEN the system SHALL display a welcome screen with plugin installation guidance
4. WHEN a plugin's dashboard component fails THEN the system SHALL show a fallback message without breaking the overall dashboard
5. IF multiple plugins provide dashboard content THEN the system SHALL organize them in a user-configurable layout

### Requirement 5: Administrative Dashboard

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want a separate admin interface to monitor system health, manage users, and oversee plugin operations, so that I can maintain a stable application environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL display system health metrics and user statistics
2. WHEN viewing plugin health THEN the system SHALL show status, performance metrics, and error counts for each plugin
3. WHEN reviewing system logs THEN the system SHALL provide searchable, filterable error and activity logs
4. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL allow viewing user profiles and basic administrative actions
5. IF system resources are low THEN the system SHALL display warnings and suggest optimization actions

### Requirement 6: UI Shell and Navigation Framework

**User Story:** As a user, I want a consistent, intuitive interface that adapts to my installed plugins, so that I can navigate efficiently between different features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a consistent navigation structure with user menu and plugin access
2. WHEN a plugin registers UI components THEN the system SHALL integrate them into the appropriate navigation areas
3. WHEN switching between plugin views THEN the system SHALL maintain navigation state and provide smooth transitions
4. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the navigation to be touch-friendly and responsive
5. IF a plugin's UI fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a fallback interface and error notification

### Requirement 7: Plugin API and Sandboxing

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want secure, well-defined APIs to integrate with the core system, so that I can build reliable plugins without compromising system security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a plugin is loaded THEN the system SHALL provide access only to explicitly exposed APIs
2. WHEN plugins communicate THEN the system SHALL route messages through a secure event system
3. WHEN a plugin requests data storage THEN the system SHALL provide sandboxed storage access specific to that plugin
4. WHEN a plugin encounters an error THEN the system SHALL contain the error and prevent system-wide failures
5. IF a plugin attempts unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL block the action and log the security violation

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Logging System

**User Story:** As a developer and user, I want comprehensive error tracking and user-friendly error displays, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log structured error information with full context
2. WHEN displaying errors to users THEN the system SHALL show helpful messages with suggested actions
3. WHEN developers need debugging information THEN the system SHALL provide detailed technical error data
4. WHEN errors are frequent THEN the system SHALL aggregate similar errors and suggest solutions
5. IF the error logging system fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to basic console logging

### Requirement 9: Automated Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing for all plugins and core functionality, so that I can ensure system reliability and catch issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL automatically run relevant tests and display results
2. WHEN a plugin is installed or updated THEN the system SHALL run the plugin's test suite before activation
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and display detailed failure information
4. WHEN viewing test results THEN the system SHALL provide clear pass/fail status with execution details
5. IF tests cannot run THEN the system SHALL log the issue and notify developers of the testing system failure
