# NeutralApp Foundation Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the comprehensive foundation work needed to transform NeutralApp from its current state into a complete, usable web application with proper modular architecture. The design addresses two critical areas: refactoring the existing codebase from technical layer organization to feature-based modular architecture, and building the missing web application layer that makes the system accessible to users.

The current NeutralApp has excellent backend services and comprehensive interfaces, but lacks the web frontend and uses technical layer organization that conflicts with the established architectural principles. This design ensures the system becomes both architecturally sound and functionally complete.

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Modular Architecture Refactoring

**Design Decision**: Complete restructuring from technical layers (`/src/services/`, `/src/interfaces/`) to feature-based modules (`/src/features/{feature-name}/`).

**Rationale**: 
- Current structure violates established architectural principles in steering documents
- Feature-based organization enables plugin conversion with minimal refactoring
- Self-contained features improve maintainability and reduce coupling
- Clear feature boundaries prevent architectural drift

**New Structure**:
