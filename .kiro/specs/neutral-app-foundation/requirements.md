# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical foundation work needed to transform NeutralApp from its current state (backend services with technical layer organization) into a complete, usable web application with proper modular architecture. The current codebase has comprehensive services and interfaces but lacks the web application layer and uses technical layer organization instead of the required feature-based modular architecture. This spec covers both the architectural refactoring and the missing web application components needed to deliver a functional product.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modular Feature-Based Architecture Refactoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase organized by features rather than technical layers, so that the system is maintainable, plugin-ready, and follows the established architectural principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a feature is implemented THEN the system SHALL contain all interfaces, services, tests, and types within that feature directory
3. WHEN features need to communicate THEN the system SHALL use only exported APIs through clear boundaries
4. WHEN converting features to plugins THEN the system SHALL require minimal refactoring due to self-contained structure
5. WHEN importing code THEN the system SHALL use relative imports within features and absolute imports for cross-feature communication
6. IF technical layer directories exist at root level THEN the system SHALL eliminate them in favor of feature organization

### Requirement 2: Web Server and Application Bootstrap
