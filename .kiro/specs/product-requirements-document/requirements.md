# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines the product vision, strategic overview, feature roadmap, and core requirements for NeutralApp. NeutralApp is a domain-agnostic, ultra-modular application shell designed as a foundation for any user-facing application. The core provides only essentials while all other features are built as plugins.

This PRD serves as the strategic product document that defines what we're building, why we're building it, and how it will evolve over time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clear Product Vision Statement

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want a clear, concise product vision, so that I understand what NeutralApp is and why it exists.

2. WHEN explaining the purpose THEN the system SHALL articulate why plugin-first architecture matters
3. WHEN identifying target users THEN the system SHALL specify developers, AI agents, plugin authors, and end users
4. WHEN positioning the product THEN the system SHALL differentiate from existing application frameworks

2. WHEN explaining architecture THEN the system SHALL summarize the modular, feature-based approach
3. WHEN describing technology stack THEN the system SHALL list key technologies and architectural decisions
4. WHEN outlining scope THEN the system SHALL clarify what's included in core vs plugins
5. WHEN showing progress THEN the system SHALL indicate completed work and current development focus
6. IF context is missing THEN the system SHALL provide background on key decisions and trade-offs

### Requirement 3: High-Level Feature Roadmap

**User Story:** As a development team, I want a high-level feature roadmap, so that I can understand priorities and plan development cycles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning releases THEN the system SHALL organize features into clear phases (Foundation, MVP, V1, Future)
2. WHEN prioritizing features THEN the system SHALL use criteria of user impact and technical dependencies
3. WHEN defining Foundation THEN the system SHALL include core platform, authentication, and basic UI

### Requirement 4: Core Product Requirements

**User Story:** As a technical architect, I want core product requirements, so that I can ensure the platform meets essential needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining core platform THEN the system SHALL specify authentication, user management, and security
2. WHEN describing plugin system THEN the system SHALL define installation, sandboxing, and API access
3. WHEN addressing user interface THEN the system SHALL specify responsive design and clean aesthetics
