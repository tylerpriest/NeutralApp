# JWT Authentication Requirements

## EARS Format Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR-1: JWT Token Generation**
- **Event**: When a user submits valid credentials
- **Actor**: Authentication system
- **Response**: Generate and return a JWT token with user information
- **State**: User is authenticated and can access protected resources

**FR-2: JWT Token Validation**
- **Event**: When a user accesses a protected endpoint
- **Actor**: Authentication middleware
- **Response**: Validate JWT token and allow/deny access accordingly
- **State**: User session is verified and maintained

**FR-3: Session Persistence**
- **Event**: When a user refreshes the browser
- **Actor**: Client-side authentication system
- **Response**: Restore user session from stored JWT token
- **State**: User remains authenticated across browser sessions

**FR-4: Secure Logout**
- **Event**: When a user logs out
- **Actor**: Authentication system
- **Response**: Invalidate JWT token and clear client-side storage
- **State**: User is logged out and cannot access protected resources

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-1: Performance**
- JWT token generation must complete within 200ms
- Token validation must complete within 100ms
- Authentication endpoints must respond within 500ms

**NFR-2: Security**
- JWT tokens must expire after 30 days
- Tokens must be signed with a secure secret key
- Client-side token storage must use secure practices
- All authentication errors must be handled gracefully

**NFR-3: Reliability**
- Authentication endpoints must have 99.9% uptime
- Token validation must work consistently across all protected routes
- Session restoration must work reliably after browser refreshes

**NFR-4: Compatibility**
- Must work seamlessly with Vite + Express architecture
- Must integrate with existing React components (AuthGuard, AuthContext)
- Must not conflict with existing application features

### User Stories

**US-1: Developer Authentication**
- **As a** developer
- **I want** a working authentication system compatible with Vite + Express
- **So that** I can build features without authentication conflicts

**US-2: User Login**
- **As a** user
- **I want** to login with email/password and stay authenticated
- **So that** I can access protected features seamlessly

**US-3: Session Persistence**
- **As a** user
- **I want** my session to persist across browser refreshes
- **So that** I don't have to login repeatedly

**US-4: Secure Access**
- **As a** user
- **I want** protected routes to be properly secured
- **So that** unauthorized users cannot access sensitive features

### Acceptance Criteria

**AC-1: Login Functionality**
- User can login with test@example.com/password123
- System returns a valid JWT token
- User is redirected to dashboard after successful login

**AC-2: Session Management**
- JWT token is stored in localStorage
- Session persists across browser refreshes
- Token is automatically included in API requests

**AC-3: Route Protection**
- AuthGuard properly protects routes
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to login
- Authenticated users can access protected routes

**AC-4: Logout Functionality**
- User can logout successfully
- JWT token is invalidated
- User is redirected to login page

**AC-5: Error Handling**
- Invalid credentials show appropriate error messages
- Expired tokens are handled gracefully
- Network errors are handled with user-friendly messages

**AC-6: Cleanup**
- All NextAuth and Supabase authentication code is removed
- No conflicting authentication dependencies remain
- All tests pass with JWT system
