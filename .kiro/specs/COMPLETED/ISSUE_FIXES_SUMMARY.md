# Issue Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the issues that were identified and fixed in the NeutralApp application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Demo Credentials Missing Admin Credentials ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The login page only showed `test@example.com` credentials, but `admin@example.com` existed in the system.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `src/web/client/pages/AuthPage.tsx` to display both regular user and admin credentials
- Enhanced the demo credentials section with separate cards for Regular User and Admin User
- Updated `src/features/auth/services/jwt.service.ts` to handle both user types
- Both users use the same password: `password123`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/web/client/pages/AuthPage.tsx`
- `src/features/auth/services/jwt.service.ts`

### 2. Browse Plugins Button Not Working ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The "Browse Plugins" button on the dashboard welcome screen had no functionality.

**Solution**:
- Updated `src/web/client/components/WelcomeScreen.tsx` to use React Router navigation
- Added `useNavigate` hook to handle navigation to `/plugins` route
- Button now properly navigates to the Plugin Manager page

**Files Modified**:
- `src/web/client/components/WelcomeScreen.tsx`

### 3. Learn More Button Not Working ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The "Learn More" button on the dashboard welcome screen had no functionality.

**Solution**:
- Updated `src/web/client/components/WelcomeScreen.tsx` to open documentation in a new tab
- Added click handler that opens GitHub repository (placeholder URL)
- Button now provides useful navigation to external resources

**Files Modified**:
- `src/web/client/components/WelcomeScreen.tsx`

### 4. Plugin Installation/Enabling/Disabling Not Updating UI ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Plugin state changes (install, enable, disable, uninstall) weren't persisting or updating the UI.

**Solution**:
- Updated `src/web/client/pages/PluginManagerPage.tsx` to connect to backend API
- Added localStorage persistence for plugin state
- Implemented proper state management with API fallback
- Added error handling and user feedback
- Updated plugin loading to merge API data with local state

**Files Modified**:
- `src/web/client/pages/PluginManagerPage.tsx`

### 5. Guest Mode Issue After Login ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Users remained in guest mode even after successful login with `test@example.com`.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `src/web/client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` authentication flow
- Reordered authentication checks to prioritize token validation over guest mode
- Added proper cleanup of guest mode when valid authentication is found
- Ensured guest mode is only set when no valid token exists

**Files Modified**:
- `src/web/client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

### 6. Dashboard Not Showing Plugin Widgets ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Installed plugins weren't creating widgets on the dashboard.

**Solution**:
- Updated `src/web/client/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` to load widgets from installed plugins
- Created `src/web/client/components/WidgetFactory.tsx` with specific widget components
- Added demo widgets for Hello World, Weather, and Task Manager plugins
- Implemented proper widget rendering with real-time updates
- Added localStorage fallback for widget state

**Files Modified**:
- `src/web/client/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`
- `src/web/client/components/WidgetFactory.tsx`

### 7. Limited Plugin Availability ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Only one plugin (demo-hello-world) was available in the system.

**Solution**:
- Added mock plugins to the Plugin Manager (Weather Widget, Task Manager)
- Created corresponding widget components for each plugin
- Updated plugin registry to include multiple plugin types
- Ensured all plugins have proper descriptions and metadata

**Files Modified**:
- `src/web/client/pages/PluginManagerPage.tsx`
- `src/web/client/components/WidgetFactory.tsx`
