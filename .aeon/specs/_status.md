## Current Sprint Focus

### Week 1-2: Authentication & Security Foundation
- **Primary:** Complete authentication system enhancement
- **Secondary:** Plugin security validation
- **Deliverable:** Secure login/logout with session management

### Week 3-4: Plugin Marketplace & UI Shell
- **Primary:** Plugin marketplace implementation  
- **Secondary:** Dashboard widget customization
- **Deliverable:** Full plugin installation and management workflow

### Week 5-6: Admin Tools & Production Readiness
- **Primary:** Admin dashboard for user and system management
- **Secondary:** Production monitoring and observability
- **Deliverable:** Complete administrative interface

## Technical Debt Priority

### 游댮 Critical (Must Fix)
1. **Authentication security gaps** - Custom JWT needs hardening
2. **Plugin data persistence** - JSON files need database migration
3. **Production observability** - No external monitoring integrated

### 游리 Important (Should Fix)
1. **UI responsiveness** - Mobile experience needs optimization
2. **Error handling** - Some edge cases not covered
3. **Performance optimization** - Bundle size and load times

### 游릭 Nice to Have (Could Fix)
1. **Advanced plugin features** - Version management, rollbacks
2. **Theme customization** - Beyond basic light/dark
3. **Advanced admin features** - Detailed analytics and reporting

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Security vulnerabilities** in custom authentication
- **Data loss risk** with file-based plugin storage
- **Performance degradation** as plugin count increases

### Medium Risk Items  
- **User experience gaps** on mobile devices
- **Plugin compatibility** issues during updates
- **Scalability limitations** with current architecture

## Success Metrics

### Development Velocity
- **Current:** 2-3 features per sprint
- **Target:** 3-4 features per sprint with improved quality

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage:** Currently 75%, target 90%
- **Bug Density:** Currently 2/1000 LOC, target <1/1000 LOC
- **Performance:** Page load <2s, interaction <100ms

### User Experience
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance target
- **Mobile Performance:** Lighthouse score >90 target
- **User Satisfaction:** Net Promoter Score >70 target

## Next Actions

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Complete authentication system specification and tasks
2. Enhance plugin security validation
3. Begin UI shell responsive design improvements

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
