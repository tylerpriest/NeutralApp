# Plugin Management System Specification

**Feature:** Plugin Discovery, Installation, and Lifecycle Management  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-04  

## Assumptions to Validate
1. Plugins are distributed as npm packages or zip files
2. Plugin marketplace is file-based initially, database-backed later
3. All plugins require security approval before installation
4. Plugin sandboxing through manifest-based permissions
5. Version management with rollback capability
6. Health monitoring and automatic recovery for failed plugins
7. Dependency resolution prevents circular dependencies
8. Plugin development follows manifest.json specification

## User Stories

### US-PLUGIN-001: Plugin Discovery
**As a** user  
**I want** to browse available plugins in a marketplace  
**So that** I can discover functionality to extend the application  

### US-PLUGIN-002: Plugin Installation
**As a** user  
**I want** to install plugins with a single click  
**So that** I can easily add new features to my application  

### US-PLUGIN-003: Plugin Management
**As a** user  
**I want** to view, enable, disable, and uninstall my plugins  
**So that** I can control which features are active in my workspace  

### US-PLUGIN-004: Plugin Health Monitoring
**As a** user  
**I want** to see the health status of my installed plugins  
**So that** I can identify and resolve any issues quickly  

### US-PLUGIN-005: Plugin Development

**I want** to approve plugins before they're available for installation  
**So that** I can ensure system security and stability  

## Acceptance Criteria (BDD)

### AC-PLUGIN-001: Plugin Discovery Interface
**Given** a user on the plugin marketplace page  
**When** they view the available plugins  
**Then** they should see plugin cards with name, description, rating, and install button  
**And** they should be able to search and filter plugins by category  
**And** they should see installation counts and user reviews  

**Measurable Checks:**
- Plugin list loads within 2 seconds
- Search returns results within 500ms
- Plugin cards contain all required metadata

### AC-PLUGIN-002: Successful Plugin Installation
**Given** a user selects a plugin to install  
**When** they click the install button  
**Then** the plugin should be downloaded and validated  
**And** dependencies should be resolved automatically  
**And** the plugin should be activated and available for use  
**And** success notification should be displayed  

**Measurable Checks:**
- Installation completes within 30 seconds
- Plugin appears in installed plugins list
- Plugin functionality is immediately available

### AC-PLUGIN-003: Plugin Installation Failure
**Given** a plugin with missing dependencies or security issues  
**When** a user attempts to install it  
**Then** the installation should fail gracefully  
**And** a clear error message should explain the failure  
**And** no partial installation should remain  

**Measurable Checks:**
- Error message displays within 3 seconds
- System remains stable after failed installation
- No orphaned files or configurations left behind

### AC-PLUGIN-004: Plugin Dependency Resolution
**Given** a plugin with dependencies on other plugins  
**When** a user installs the plugin  
**Then** all required dependencies should be identified  
**And** missing dependencies should be installed automatically  
**And** dependency conflicts should be detected and reported  

**Measurable Checks:**
- Dependency tree calculated correctly
- Circular dependencies rejected
- Version conflicts resolved or reported

### AC-PLUGIN-005: Plugin Health Monitoring
**Given** installed plugins running in the system  
**When** a plugin encounters an error or stops responding  
**Then** the health monitor should detect the failure  
**And** attempt automatic recovery  
**And** notify the user if recovery fails  

**Measurable Checks:**
- Plugin failures detected within 10 seconds
- Recovery attempts made automatically
- User notifications sent for unrecoverable failures

### AC-PLUGIN-006: Plugin Security Validation
**Given** a plugin submitted for installation  
**When** the system validates the plugin  
**Then** the manifest should be verified for required fields  
**And** the plugin code should be scanned for security violations  
**And** permissions should be validated against the manifest  

**Measurable Checks:**
- Manifest validation completes in <1 second
- Security scan completes in <10 seconds
- Permission violations are detected and blocked

## SDD Examples & Edge Cases

### Example 1: Plugin Manifest Structure
```json
{
  "name": "reading-core",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "description": "Core reading functionality for digital books",
  "author": "NeutralApp Team",
  "main": "index.js",
  "permissions": [
    "file:read",
    "storage:write",
    "ui:widget"
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "file-manager": "^1.0.0"
  },
  "categories": ["reading", "productivity"],

  "widgets": [
    {
      "id": "current-book",
      "name": "Current Book",
      "component": "CurrentBookWidget"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Plugin Installation API Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "plugin": {
    "id": "reading-core-v1.2.0",
    "name": "reading-core",
    "version": "1.2.0",

}
```

### Edge Cases & Failure States

#### Edge Case 1: Circular Dependencies
**Scenario:** Plugin A depends on Plugin B, which depends on Plugin A  
**Expected:** Installation blocked with clear error message  
**Error:** "Circular dependency detected: reading-core → file-manager → reading-core"  

#### Edge Case 2: Version Conflicts
**Scenario:** Plugin requires version 2.0 of dependency, but version 1.0 is installed  
**Expected:** User prompted to upgrade dependency or cancel installation  
**Resolution:** Automatic dependency upgrade with user confirmation  

#### Edge Case 3: Permission Escalation
**Scenario:** Plugin requests permissions not declared in manifest  
**Expected:** Runtime permission violation detected and plugin sandboxed  
**Recovery:** Plugin disabled, user notified, admin alerted  

#### Failure State 1: Plugin Marketplace Unavailable
**Scenario:** Plugin repository is down or unreachable  
**Expected:** Cached plugin list displayed with offline indicator  
**Fallback:** Local plugin installation from file upload  

#### Failure State 2: Plugin Corruption
**Scenario:** Plugin file becomes corrupted after installation  
**Expected:** Health monitor detects corruption, attempts reinstallation  
**Recovery:** Plugin automatically reinstalled from source  

#### Failure State 3: Memory Leak in Plugin
**Scenario:** Plugin consumes excessive memory over time  
**Expected:** Resource monitor detects leak, plugin restarted  
**Alerting:** User notified of plugin performance issues
