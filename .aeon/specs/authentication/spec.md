# Authentication System Specification

**Feature:** User Authentication and Session Management  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-04  

## Assumptions to Validate
1. Single-tenant deployment with admin-managed user accounts
2. JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration and refresh capability
3. Role-based access control with user/admin roles
4. Password reset via email (placeholder for future email service)
5. Session persistence across browser restarts
6. No external OAuth integration initially (custom auth only)

## User Stories

### US-AUTH-001: User Login
**As a** registered user  
**I want** to log into the application with my credentials  
**So that** I can access my personalized dashboard and features  

### US-AUTH-002: User Session Management
**As a** logged-in user  
**I want** my session to persist across browser restarts  
**So that** I don't have to re-authenticate frequently  

### US-AUTH-003: User Logout  
**As a** logged-in user  
**I want** to securely log out of the application  
**So that** my session is terminated and my data is protected  

### US-AUTH-004: Password Reset
**As a** user who forgot their password  
**I want** to reset my password securely  
**So that** I can regain access to my account  

### US-AUTH-005: Admin User Management
**As an** administrator  
**I want** to create, update, and deactivate user accounts  
**So that** I can manage system access and user lifecycle  

## Acceptance Criteria (BDD)

### AC-AUTH-001: Successful Login
**Given** a registered user with valid credentials  
**When** they submit login form with correct username and password  
**Then** they should receive a valid JWT token  
**And** be redirected to their dashboard  
**And** their session should be established  

**Measurable Checks:**
- JWT token contains user ID, role, and expiration
- Dashboard loads within 2 seconds
- Authentication state persists in localStorage

### AC-AUTH-002: Failed Login
**Given** a user with invalid credentials  
**When** they submit login form with incorrect username or password  
**Then** they should see an error message "Invalid credentials"  
**And** no JWT token should be issued  
**And** they should remain on the login page  

**Measurable Checks:**
- Error message displays within 1 second
- No token stored in localStorage
- Login attempts logged for security monitoring

### AC-AUTH-003: Session Persistence
**Given** a logged-in user with valid session  
**When** they close and reopen their browser  
**Then** they should remain logged in  
**And** be redirected to dashboard instead of login page  

**Measurable Checks:**
- JWT token valid and not expired
- User role and permissions maintained
- Dashboard loads without re-authentication

### AC-AUTH-004: Session Expiration
**Given** a logged-in user with expired session  
**When** they attempt to access protected resources  
**Then** they should be redirected to login page  
**And** see message "Session expired, please log in again"  

**Measurable Checks:**
- Expired token rejected by server
- User redirected within 1 second
- Session cleared from localStorage

### AC-AUTH-005: Secure Logout
**Given** a logged-in user  
**When** they click logout button  
**Then** their JWT token should be invalidated  
**And** they should be redirected to login page  
**And** all session data should be cleared  

**Measurable Checks:**
- Token removed from localStorage
- Server-side token blacklisted
- Redirect to login page immediate

## ATDD Table

| Preconditions | Steps | Expected Result |
|---------------|-------|-----------------|
| User database contains test user | 1. Navigate to login page<br>2. Enter valid credentials<br>3. Click login | User redirected to dashboard with valid session |
| User database contains test user | 1. Navigate to login page<br>2. Enter invalid password<br>3. Click login | Error message displayed, remain on login page |
| User logged in with valid session | 1. Close browser<br>2. Reopen browser<br>3. Navigate to app | User automatically logged in to dashboard |
| User logged in 25 hours ago | 1. Navigate to protected page | User redirected to login with session expired message |
| User currently logged in | 1. Click logout button | User redirected to login page, session cleared |
| Admin user logged in | 1. Navigate to admin panel<br>2. Create new user account | New user account created and accessible |

## SDD Examples & Edge Cases

### Example 1: Successful Login Flow
**Input:**
```json
{
  "username": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!"
}
```
**Output:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "user": {
    "id": "user_123",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "role": "user",
    "name": "John Doe"
  },
  "expiresIn": "24h"
}
```

### Example 2: Failed Login
**Input:**
```json
{
  "username": "john.doe@example.com", 
  "password": "WrongPassword"
}
```
**Output:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid credentials",
  "code": "AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS"
}
```

### Edge Cases & Failure States

#### Edge Case 1: Concurrent Sessions
**Scenario:** User logs in from multiple devices  
**Expected:** Each device gets independent session, both remain valid  
**Current Limitation:** No session limit enforcement  

#### Edge Case 2: Password Complexity
**Scenario:** User attempts weak password during registration  
**Expected:** Password rejected with specific requirements  
**Requirements:** Min 8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, 1 special char  

#### Edge Case 3: Brute Force Protection
**Scenario:** Multiple failed login attempts from same IP  
**Expected:** Account locked for 15 minutes after 5 attempts  
**Current Gap:** No rate limiting implemented  

#### Failure State 1: JWT Secret Compromise
**Scenario:** JWT secret key is compromised  
**Recovery:** Rotate secret, invalidate all existing tokens, force re-login  

#### Failure State 2: Database Connection Lost
**Scenario:** User database unavailable during login  
**Expected:** Graceful error message, retry mechanism  
**Fallback:** Cached authentication for existing sessions only
