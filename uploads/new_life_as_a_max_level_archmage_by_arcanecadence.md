# New Life As A Max Level Archmage

**Author:** ArcaneCadence

**Description:** Vivienne has poured so many hours into the massively popular VRMMO The Seven Cataclysms that she has more of a life inside the game than out. It's a fitting irony, then, when one day she wakes in the body of her maxed-out demon-mage 'Vivisari'—and finds that now, the game really is her reality.
But the world of Seven Cataclysms isn't what she remembers. A hundred years have passed since the game's concluding events, and Vivisari is a hero of myth thought long dead. As she meets old faces and new in this familiar-yet-not world—casting spells of mass destruction and slowly reforming the scattered-to-the-wind remnants of her Guild—she starts to wonder if she was sent here with a purpose. 
Rumors of a sequel had been circulating just before her unbelievable reincarnation. Did she, perhaps, need to fear an impending Eighth Cataclysm?
If so, it's a good thing she has firepower in spades.

## Chapter 1: 1 - Vivisari


                <p class="cnNkM2ExNWUyNjBlNTQ1MmQ4ZWQ5MDU2ODU0MDM1Zjgx">Vivi opened her eyes to the Burial Room of the Ashen Hierophant.</p>
<p class="cnM2MWZmMzNhMDlhZDQ4ZTJhMTY5MDI3MmJmMGU0OTk3">It had been two years since she had logged into The Seven Cataclysms, but she instantly recognized the scenery of its final boss fight. How couldn’t she? She’d run it at least a thousand times.</p>
<p class="cnNkODI5ZDk2Y2NlYTQ4OTFiOWM2MGJkZTZiYmFlNTAw">She groggily pushed herself up against the armrest of the massive obsidian throne, blinking at the yawning spires enclosing the arena. Lava bubbled a dozen feet away, heat licking at her face.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDNkOGZkMzIwYTQ1YmRhYWZjMWJkYzg4MjA4NmZm">“What?” she mumbled, head foggy. “Where…where am I?”</p>
<p class="cnNiOGM2MTFlYmJkNjQ3MjhiNTZhYTM5OGRmNTI2NDFl">Hazily, she looked down at herself. She was dressed in a hooded black robe covering her from neck to ankles, a thick, luxurious garment gilded with swirling purple designs. It was a familiar piece of gear. As the best-in-slot robes for mages, she wore them around constantly. Just, they'd never been so real. Uncomprehending, she tugged at the fabric and felt it adjust across her skin.</p>
<p class="cnM5M2Y4MmRmYTFlOTRjOTNhMzZiNDIxNDMxNTRiNTll">The natural conclusion was that she’d fallen asleep still logged into the massively popular VRMMO The Seven Cataclysms. But there was one problem with that. Technology was improving fast, but even the most advanced games couldn’t imitate real life. Not to this degree.</p>
<p class="cnNiNzBkZmNmODQwMDQ1OGFiYTQxM2YyYWIwMzAwYWFi">The sound of bubbling lava, the sweltering heat, the feel of this robe brushing against her skin—those subtleties couldn’t be imitated.</p>
<p class="cnNlNzY2ZmI5ZmE5ZDRiZDRhYjhhNTE1YWQwMDBmNmI0">“What in the world?”</p>
<p class="cnM1YjM5NDRmOGI0ODRjMThhMjkyMDc5MDc3ZGE5ZDIz">Unsteadily rising to her feet, Vivi swept her gaze around the Ashen Hierophant’s arena, her brain working into overdrive.</p>
<p class="cnNkNGMyOGNhYjJiZDRjMWE5MGQ1Y2I1OWFkNjRmOGZm">“[Status],” she said.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTZlY2IyZjZjYzQ5OWRhZDJmYTU0MTU5NzEwZjc4">A screen appeared in front of her.</p>
<p class="cnMyYmNjMjg5ZjMwNDRhODk5Yjg3YmYyNGQzYWUzNjc1">***</p>
<p class="cnNmNjczZDZiOWRlMjQ3ZGY5YjhkYmQ0MzE5MjMxZDM4">Vivisari Vexaria</p>
<p class="cnM2ODBkZTgyMDM1NjRlMmJhMDkyZjUxZGQ0OGI1Nzk1">&lt;Usurper of the Ashen Throne&gt;</p>
<p class="cnNjMWQyMGIzYWZlNTQxZTg5ZmJlZjc4OGM2Y2NmMjM2">(Vanguard)</p>
<p class="cnNlZjkzMmMzYTRmMDQ2ZDhhODFkNmU0ZjM1MjgwMmVm">Level 2109 Demon [Archmage]</p>
<p class="cnMzM2Y1MWYwZjYzNDQ3NmM5NDg4YWVlMjkyMzBiNTky">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="cnM1MGI3OTMxMTBhMDQxY2JiODM2NzVlMGI1MjgxNmQ4">STR: 162,196</p>
<p class="cnM3MmJmMmVlYTlmZjQ0Mzc5MDVmNTRiNjlhZjIxNzFm">AGI: 102,342</p>
<p class="cnNjZjExODdmODk3YjRlYzg5OTMyZTdjNjdmZmZmOGUz">CON: 1,188,232</p>
<p class="cnNiNTVhZGI2MzYyZjQ1YTI4OTE2MzAzMmQ0OWYyODBk">MAG: 24,923,239</p>
<p class="cnMzYmUzMWY2MWViMjRmZmVhYzhmN2I2MmFjMjM4ZjM2">WIS: 7,693,326</p>
<p class="cnM2MGNhNWNmYjc4MDQ0MTliN2NkNWE0NzZmNWVhYzdi">***</p>
<p class="cnNkZWU2MzE3N2NkZTQ4MmI4ZjQ2ZTBmYTY3M2M5OGIy">For a long while, she stared at the status screen, numbly trying to comprehend what had happened.</p>
<p class="cnM2MjFjYWEzNDIwZTRlODhhYTY2NzlmNGQ0NTdmYWZi">“Might have gone crazy, I suppose,” she said. Her voice sounded weird to her own ears—like it wasn’t her own.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTE1NjJiNDVlODQzMzk4ZmZmZjU2NzdmZmU0NzU1">Because it <em>wasn't</em> her own.</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2RlM2YyMTA5YTQxNzQ5MWQ0ZjdhNTcwZTA3OWVk">She looked down at her pale white hands. The creases were in the wrong spots. That might seem like something a person wouldn't notice easily, but she did so instantly. She traced one of the lines, then closed that hand into a fist. She shivered. Her hand quested up to touch her cheeks next, and she marveled at how realistic the sensation was.</p>
<p class="cnM1MWJjYWUzMTUzZTRiOTVhODUyZWQ2OWJkZWI5MmY0">She was definitely here, in the flesh. There was no denying that. And it was no dream; she would have woken from shock alone.</p>
<p class="cnM3NzBiOThhZmYzNzQ5YmJhYWY0ODJkNmYwMTdjOTQ4">On top of that, she wasn't even in her own body, but that of her character, Vivisari Vexaria.</p>
<p class="cnM0ODBmNzk0NjgwNDQyODRiOTczNDYyMDMzZDM2ZmVm">As for the name…look. She’d made the character when she was fifteen. Sure, she could have changed it, but she’d grown attached to the slightly edgy imaginations of her younger self. And honestly, she’d only sort of outgrown that love for flair. Enough so that she recognized, fine, it <em>was</em> dramatic, but she secretly kept liking it anyway.</p>
<p class="cnMxNDNkZjE3MjFmODRlODZiYTliMWUxZTk1ZWNhNzEw">“But how?” Vivi asked, head spinning.</p>
<p class="cnMwNDcxZjI4YTMwNzRmM2ZiODQzNzEwNDJjMDQ5ZTkx">Yesterday had been a repeat of her not-very-admirable lifestyle: grind all day, go to bed with bags under her eyes. Nothing explained her transmigration. Certainly she hadn’t thrown herself in front of a bus to save a clueless child, then after being splattered across the road, been granted an audience with a sympathetic goddess with an offer to reincarnate into a world of her choice.</p>
<p class="cnNiMDU2NTY5Y2VmMDRlMGJhN2IxNWZmNjE1MmZjMjg5">She giggled at the idea, the noise tinted with panic more than amusement, and she cut herself off and took a calming breath.</p>
<p class="cnMwZDk3YWRiNmI5YzRhNWZhMmRjOTI2YTFiNjZkNGJk">Well, anyway.</p>
<p class="cnM3OWMxNTJjYjBjNzQwOTA5YmM2MDc0ZmQ3MWRlZWVk">She needed to focus on reality. No amount of pinching herself was helping. It was only reminding her how real<em> </em>the tactile feedback was.</p>
<p class="cnM0Mzc5NTQ0MTlhMjQwYTc4MTAxNDAzYjUzN2NlZDRi">It made no sense whatsoever, but she <em>was </em>here, in the Burial Room of the Ashen Hierophant.</p>
<p class="cnMwYWM2M2E4Zjg4YjQ1MzBiNmZlMzVmZDcxMTc4ZGU3">Almost because<em> </em>of how strange it was, she focused on the practical. On what she could actually do, as a way to distract herself.</p>
<p class="cnNmZmM3ZjQxZjI2OTQwMDJiYmQzNjkxYTc1N2Q2MDQx">“[Inventory],” she commanded.</p>
<p class="cnNlY2IyMTIzMDUzODQ1ZTk4YWYxZTgwNWVhZGZmNWQy">She scanned the grid-like display, flipping through pages to confirm. The scant few items—a set of potions and some miscellaneous consumables—jogged her memory as to what she’d been doing when she had last logged off.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjNjODg0MDE1NjQzYjJiOWIxZTcwMmIwYzQ4Mjg2">Seven Cataclysms was a skill-based game, with almost all attacks being dodgeable or counterable, so technically, it was possible to clear even late-game raids solo. Even the final raid. And she’d done just that: cleared The Burial Room of the Ashen Hierophant on mythical difficulty. She had earned the unique title Usurper of the Ashen Throne for it.</p>
<p class="cnMxN2ZmOGQ4NjNkMDRjZTI5YzhhNjg4NjNjMmZhY2Qy">Point being: in Seven Cataclysms, unsecured items and gold were dropped on death, so she’d been doing those challenge runs with a set of minimal supplies. She had barely anything.</p>
<p class="cnM4NTgzN2UwMGZmMTQxMjNhZTM2ZDQ3NjUxMTUzMzNk">Her best gear was equipped at least, since that wasn’t dropped on death.</p>
<p class="cnM2YjEyMDY2MzViZDQxZWViMmI1MTBjMDJmMTIwZWNh">“[Guild],” she voiced next.</p>
<p class="cnNkM2E3OTA2Y2M3NDQ1Mjk5YjU1YWMxOWRjMmVhYzlh">Unlike when she’d tried to open her inventory, the voice command didn’t yield a status screen. Brow furrowing, she tried again.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzRjZTA5NWE1ZjQ4OGRhMzI2N2RkYjhlNmIxN2Q1">“[Guild]. [Guild Status]. [Guild Management].”</p>
<p class="cnMyNTU4OGZkMTNmNjRmZmRhNDg0OTc0ZDQ5NTQ0MWNi">None worked.</p>
<p class="cnMxNWJjYjBlZjk1NTRkZmQ5MDMwMjJkNmRhZTIyZTQ2">Hm.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjAzM2M3MWUxNDQ1NWRhYWRlNzAyNTcyNDgzMDU1">So, the game functions weren’t one-to-one. Whatever had happened, she couldn’t rely on this world to act identically to the game she knew.</p>
<p class="cnMxYTlkOGM4OTljMTRiMzdiNmRmNDY2NzA3ZjYzZWRh">“[Skills]?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNGI2MjU0N2VkZjRmNTZiMzVlZjUwYzQyYmM1ZTY2">A screen cram-packed with abilities appeared. Nothing looked out of place, but it would take a while to confirm.</p>
<p class="cnM3MTc4YTVkYzU3OTRhOWY4YjVhMjNkZWMxNTA0YTE0">“[Quests].”</p><span class="cjdiMDAzOTZmMWI4MDRiOWFiNzdkMzY3YWNiZjg3NzY3"><br>You might be reading a pirated copy. Look for the official release to support the author.<br></span>
<p class="cnM4MmM2NzhmZjFhNDRlODA5OWFkNzQzNTkyMGJmNDQz">No response.</p>
<p class="cnNlOTZjNjVmMzkzZDRmNGRiM2YzYTFlN2YzNWUwMDNi">“[Map].”</p>
<p class="cnNlNTVjNGJjMWE5YTRjYzk4ZjgzMzQ5MDVjNTFmYTQ2">Nothing.</p>
<p class="cnM0OGNmMzI1OTBkYzQ3M2NiMzEwYzVjZmNmNjMyM2Rk">“[Crafting].”</p>
<p class="cnM0NTA5Yzk0MzIyNTRjMTI4ZTkwNmM4YjM4OTg1NzAw">That was interesting. But she would deal with that later.</p>
<p class="cnM0MGM5YzQzMDAzMDQ1NDJhYjA0MGE4MzhmYzRiMTJl">“[Friends].”</p>
<p class="cnMwOGVhMWMzZTk5ODRlZjJhNzNjOTUzZDljODE1NTg2">Once more, no result.</p>
<p class="cnNmMjZiZjAwMmVjNzQzM2M5MTYyZjAyZmI1NjAwYmY0">“[Settings].”</p>
<p class="cnM3NTFmNDBlMjZmYTRjYjJiYjhmYTNiOTg4YmRmZjc3">To be fair, she hadn’t expected that one to work.</p>
<p class="cnNiNGM0ZmVhNDE2NjQxYjViYzEwOGI4ZGU5YTIwMzNk">“[Log Out]. [Quit]. [Force Quit]. [Request Moderator]. [Report]?”</p>
<p class="cnMyMjlmYjc3NDk3MDRkN2ViOWJiMmM1Y2VmMzNiNDEz">Nor any of those.</p>
<p class="cnNkZTA5ZDQwOTJlMTQ2NGY5NWNjNDAzYThkNmRkMDMx">She rattled off a few more commands to little avail. It seemed there were a few screens she could use, but most of the meta-functionality of the game had been removed.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDBhNWI0MDU2MjRkZDliMTg0YzY2ZWE1MTk1Yjlk">She mulled over what to do.</p>
<p class="cnMxOGMyYzQxMDU0YzRlYzliMzgxYzg1NDdkMzNhODFk">There was one immediate factor that would determine her next steps.</p>
<p class="cnM0NjE2NzY1ZDZlYTQ2NGNiMTdmNDAxOGU1NmY1MWZj">Could she die?</p>
<p class="cnMxNzc4MWU0OWMyZDQ0YWJiM2QwNDQ1NWM2MmNjYWMx">Rather, could she respawn? There were no resurrection spells in Seven Cataclysms. When a player died, they were reborn in the nearest temple, all unsecured items and gold dropping on their death point.</p>
<p class="cnMyMjI3NTFmN2NhOTRmMGFhNTgxZGQ5ZjRlMzYyY2Zh">Did real life work that way?</p>
<p class="cnM2NDdkMGFkZDkwMjQxY2M4Y2YyMTdmOThiMjllNWU0">“Not that this is real life,” she muttered.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzhkNjZhYzY5YjQzYzFiMDM0ODVkMjQyNzk2YzNj">Though it was. Her head hurt thinking about it.</p>
<p class="cnNjOGU4OWM3ZjEzYTQ5YjM5YzlmZDBkNjdkNDdmNDg5">If she could die, she needed to be cautious. A visit to a temple would give an answer, so that was her first goal.</p>
<p class="cnM2Zjc0ZjExZjIwMzRiNzlhZmNlOTcwYjJlZDFiMzRi">To the nearest city then?</p>
<p class="cnM5NmFiMGViNGFjZTRmNWE4ZTU5YWYwNDVmNTMyOWI3">Scanning her ability list, she found the skill she was looking for: [Greater Warp]. Before she teleported out, she hesitated.</p>
<p class="cnM5YTViMDk0NDlhODQ5Nzg5NDZjMWQ4ZWY1NjhhOWZi">There was one more thing she needed to check.</p>
<p class="cnNmNjgzY2RlMGRiNDQzNTlhMDgwNGRjMzBiODQ3Njkw">Looking around, her eyes landed on the obsidian throne. Walking behind to gain access to a large, smooth section of glassy black material, she rubbed her sleeve around to polish herself a mirror.</p>
<p class="cnM5OTc2OGQ0ZjM3NDQxNWZhNjA2N2Q3NWVlNmYyYTVh">Her in-game avatar stared back.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzM3NjJhNDU5YTRkNTRiNjBmNTU1MDUzNjNmZjBm">“Oh, no,” Vivi said with dawning horror.</p>
<p class="cnM2NDllMjRkNGM5ZDQ4YTNhZWRjMTc3ODA2ZDg0YWE0">Her flair for the dramatic extended beyond how she named her characters.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjgzMzg5YjQ1OTQzYTk5YmQwYjk5ZTQwNDYyODAw">“Why?” she groaned.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZGYzZGFlMmMyYTQ5NTliZDFiYTlhNjY1YjJhMGVl">She had long curling demon horns, which she tugged on with amazement. A pale face with a neutral expression and bored red eyes. Long white hair that cascaded down to her mid-back.</p>
<p class="cnM3MThhY2M3M2U3NDRjYTk4NzkwN2Q1OTQ4ZGQ1OTAy">All of that was fine. It was in the realm of normalcy for a fantasy-world character.</p>
<p class="cnMyZDRhNTAwZWIxZDRkNGFhYmQwYTA4MmVkOWFkNTdj">But one particular aesthetic choice made her wince. She traced a finger down her cheek, mortification growing at the two blood-red tattoos starting at her eyes and descending, imitating tear stains.</p>
<p class="cnM3MGVhYzY2MjI4YzQzZDZhOTVlOGQ3MjIzZjE4Mjcz">She sighed.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTJkYmM2NzE1MDRhZTRiMDFkMDYyZTQ5ODllOWE4">Maybe she had enjoyed the aesthetic when it was an avatar in a game—and secretly did even now—but now that she was living<em> </em>in<em> </em>this body, she looked at her reflection and decided, no, definitely not. She would not be walking around in public with red tear trails going down her cheeks.</p>
<p class="cnM2MzRjNDI1MjhjYTQwNGJhMDk3ZmNkYzc1NDVmYzJh">There wasn’t much evidence supporting the claim, but she did have some sense of shame.</p>
<p class="cnMxOTI1ZWRlZmMyZjRmNTc5MjQyZmVmZjYzOTI5YWUw">Unfortunately, scrubbing furiously at the marks didn’t help.</p>
<p class="cnMyNDA5Nzc3NWVlZjRhNGFhMDI3YmM1ODI3NGRiMTJl">“At least I have magic, I guess? [Illusion] should be able to fix it?”</p>
<p class="cnMzMWQ0NmRlNjIxNjQ2OWM4ZjUxNjliNzRkZDQ2ZTA4">As a band-aid solution, anyway.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjA4MmY1NDBkMDRiZWQ4NWNiNjgwZjBiYzMwYThk">Getting rid of the distinguishing trait was probably smart from a tactical perspective, regardless. She wanted to gather information about the world and remain incognito. As the game’s highest-ranked player, and someone who had been—what, reincarnated?—straight into the game’s world, she suspected the name ‘Vivisari Vexaria’ would draw attention. And there probably weren’t many demons walking around with blood-trail eye tattoos.</p>
<p class="cnNlNmJmYmE0ZWY3MTQ2ZmI4NWIwNWFkYTNlZjI5OTFi">So, some quick magic to clean up the mistakes of her former self, then off to civilization.</p>
<p class="cnM4YWQwNTNlODFkMjQ5ODE4YWVlNmEzMTBhMGJhOGU3">“Magic,” she said, musing over the word.</p>
<p class="cnMwODJmZTdiMzJkNTQ3MzNhZTMyN2E1MmI1NTk0NTZl">Magic was cool. She had always thought that. She picked some variant of a mage class in every game she played. If a game didn’t have a mage class, that usually meant she wasn’t playing it.</p>
<p class="cnNlYTk1ZWUxZmVkNTQyYzhiMzg3YmEwYzMyODgzYTRj">One of the reasons she’d fallen in love with Seven Cataclysms was the excellent design behind abilities and especially spells. There were a seemingly endless number, and each had been so fun to use. The visual design of the game was unparalleled for its time, and the tactile and other sensory feedback, while primitive, was good enough that certain spells and fights could get her heart racing even after tens of thousands of hours of gameplay.</p>
<p class="cnMzN2RlOGFhNzUyMzRmNTQ4NzQxMzg0NWQ5ZmRkZDJm">Magic in real life—for a twisted meaning of that phrase, ‘real life’—was even cooler. And it didn’t work at all like how it did in Seven Cataclysms.</p>
<p class="cnMxOWQ1NWIyMDQzNTQxZjI4ZGU2YWFkYTU1ZmVlMDNh">She would only realize she should be disturbed after the fact, but her brain knew what to do despite having definitely never cast a spell before. Mentally reaching inward to a glowing ball of energy sitting somewhere high in her stomach, she funneled mana through the many channels running through her body and extruded that white-hot resource into the air.</p>
<p class="cnMwMTc4Y2I4YmQyODQ4YjI4MzI1ZmZjZjQ2MmUzNzM3">And then things really got weird. Through instincts she shouldn’t have, she molded the mana with her mind, shaped it, twisted it into proper form, folding long strands of molten energy into swirling shapes and patterns that began to take on their own meaning. Until eventually, somehow, she had finished.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTRhM2VmYjNhMTRjNDBiMzk0MWYzZWZlNTFmNGI4">“[Illusion],” she incanted.</p>
<p class="cnNkZjY0MjhhOGJkYzQwMDE4ZWIyNDk1ODFiNGY2ZTYz">The air in front of her shimmered, and she was done. She peeked into the glassy mirror of the obsidian throne and confirmed she no longer had red trails running down her eyes—and also, the recognizable design of the Vestments of the Voidwalker had lost its purple designs to appear instead as plain black robes. Those too, after all, might draw attention, and it wasn’t like she had a change of clothing on hand.</p>
<p class="cnMwNjQ3ZTcxOGEwNTQ0NDk4M2U3N2IzMTFkZjgxZWYw">But more importantly.</p>
<p class="cnMwYjU5MmRmNzBhNzQyMDM5ZGRiMDg0MTgxY2ExMmI4">“What was <em>that?”</em></p>
<p class="cnM0YzU5ZWVjY2JlODQwYTU5ZTYwM2ZlNWQyZWU2MGY3">Nothing had felt unusual about the process of channeling and shaping mana. It had felt as natural as breathing, something she’d done a million times before. And it had definitely been her first time casting magic.</p>
<p class="cnMyMWQyZmIxMDc0YjQzNTY5OGYzMmYxMmJhOWQ5YzYx">Where had that familiarity come from? It wasn’t like a VRMMO like Seven Cataclysms could hook so thoroughly into a person’s brain. While she loved how diverse the spells were, actual spellcasting was as simple as invoking the appropriate vocal commands or using an assigned series of gestures.</p>
<p class="cnNiOWY2OTY4MjgxOTQ4MzFhYjRkYzczMWVkOWRlNWQ5">So she hadn’t just been given a new body. But also a new mind? Or rather extra stuff had been packed in. Stuff appropriate to the character, Vivisari Vexaria.</p>
<p class="cnM4NDMzNGNjOGViZTQ1MWU4ZGI3MThiM2YxZTNjOWU0">That was…weird? But kinda cool? She had extremely mixed feelings. A person's mind was what made them <em>them</em>.</p>
<p class="cnMyYTQ5OWJkN2M0ZjQyYjM4ODhiOGY5MzhmOTQ5Y2Ux">That said, she felt like the same person. She was certain nothing else about her had changed. She'd just picked up a few tricks. Still, it was bizarre enough to unnerve her.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDVjNTc1NmVhNTQ5ZDA5ZGIzZmFiNTMxMzUyOTJi">As weird and slightly terrifying as it was suddenly having the instincts of an experienced spellcaster lurking in her brain, though, she had just used magic. In a far realer way than any game ever could imitate. That made up for almost anything.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDUyNzBlNzdhZjRmM2Q4MTRkYTY1Y2UzMWE3M2I4">Forcing herself to move past the experience—in the same way she was ignoring the whole, somehow-in-a-different-world thing—she began to layer protective spells into herself.</p>
<p class="cnMwOTI1MWRlMjQzZjQ4MjZiZDQ0MjU0NjhlNWE0YzY3">“[Adamantine Aegis].”</p>
<p class="cnMwMDRjY2UzMDQ1MTRlNGFhZDEzZDIzMmM2ZmVhMjky">“[Shell of the Fallen].”</p>
<p class="cnNjZWUwMWIyY2I5MTQxOTY4NTU3ZjIyYWI2YjJkM2Q1">“[Mind Fortress].”</p>
<p class="cnM3MWJmOTYyMDE0ZjQyNjRhMjczMDA3ZmY4NmRiZGFh">“[Vortex of Negation].”</p>
<p class="cnNkMmE4NWVkMTllMDQxZmM4MTQ2NzI1ZjUzMDkwMGQ4">And so on and so on. That process she went through whenever preparing for a serious fight. Each spell was <em>fascinating </em>to cast, requiring a different shaping of mana to create the desired effect.</p>
<p class="cnNhNDA1MjBmMGJhODQyNjQ5Y2FlZTFmMjNlYjgwYzFh">She added two more effects to the list, just in case.</p>
<p class="cnM5MTBiYmNiMjUzNjQzYmQ5YTU0NjY4MmY2NGE3OTk5">“[Invisibility].”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTQwM2Y0M2IyOTQ3ODU5MTE0OWQ1ZGI5Mzg3OThi">“[Conceal Presence].”</p>
<p class="cnMyYzA1OGYzYjliNTQ5MGFiNjJiYzY0YjY2ZmQ2NzMy">By the time she was done, she’d gotten a good taste for what casting real magic was like, and there was a satisfied buzzing in her skull. Yes, she was very much going to enjoy messing around with what she could do. But later. She had more important goals.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjMyOTlkMGVmYjQ4ODY4M2UzMjQ1ZDhjMzNmZjc4">Ready for whatever she might find in the capital, she began casting her final spell. [Greater Warp]. But halfway through shaping the mana, she crashed into a brick wall with a sudden realization.</p>
<p class="cnM0OWJhYWE0YWYxNDQ1MzI4MzQwNDYzMjM2YTFkM2I2">She couldn’t complete the spell, because she had no target. There were no [Warp Anchors]. Her items and levels had carried over, but her warp points had been wiped clean.</p>
<p class="cnNlYzQ1NDkwZWI4ZjRkZWRhNDJmOGI5NjdmM2U1MTM3">She pulled the mana back into herself, grimacing. It wasn’t a pleasant experience. But releasing that much half-shaped mana into the air would result in something catastrophic, with the mana taking a life of its own and choosing what it wanted to be. Which never ended well. Magic, given a choice, preferred chaos. Another aspect of spellcasting she just knew somehow.</p>
<p class="cnM5YWY2OWUyNTM4OTRkODQ5YjI3ZWU1MDRjNTllNDVm">“Huh.”</p>
<p class="cnMyYjg5MTNkMzlhYjQwODhhOTY4NTlhMmNiZWM4NTA1">So [Greater Warp] was out. The next best option was Fast Traveling, but she wasn’t able to access the map.</p>
<p class="cnM4MzYwNjU3ODI0MzQ4Nzg4MmZhODI1MDZlNGJlZmNk">“Am I going to have to walk?” she asked incredulously.</p>
<p class="cnMzZmFlNjI3MGY2ZjQwNDc4NzFmYjkxZTE3ZWM1MmM3">Well, no. She had spells to speed up travel, flight and acceleration to name the obviously useful ones, but the world of Seven Cataclysms was huge. Even with those, it would take a while to move any great distance.</p>
<p class="cnNmZDBkMDUzNWJkNTQwOWJhNjJmOWIxMDhjOTI1NWMz">“There’s still [Gate To Nearest City],” she mumbled. “That’ll get me to Prismarche, but Meridian is thousands of miles south.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMGZhMWUzNmE5MjRjMWM4ODAyYWNlMjVkYjMyOWFj">Not that she had any idea how space would translate.  Clearly, she couldn’t trust everything in this world being one-to-one. But the final Cataclysm had been as far north on the continent as possible, and Meridian, the capital city of the human kingdoms, was roughly two-thirds down.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDliNDQxZTczOTRiYmE4ZjEzZTBiYWRmMmE2MDc2">“Can I really not warp?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYzhkMzFkYzhjMzQ5MjY5Njk2MzExMTE2MmE2ZTBj">Getting to Meridian was important for a few reasons: that was where both the Guildhall and her personal house were located, and thus a majority of her items…assuming those hadn’t been wiped clean too, which she hoped wasn’t the case. When she looked at her status, she was still in the Vanguard guild, so that at a minimum hadn’t disappeared. Even if she couldn’t access the Guild tab.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmRhNWMyOWJmYjQ0NDA4ZDYxZTI0YjIzZDAyYTE3">Unfortunately, she couldn’t think of a way to instantly transport herself there if [Greater Warp] had no [Warp Anchors] to link to. Just like in the game, she’d have to get there manually and set one. That meant tons of hours on a Greateagle, probably, or flying herself.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZGU0NzVmNDMxNTQzZjI5ZDVhNGFjODgxNGJmYjkw">That didn’t actually sound so bad. Flying through the sky and watching the world of Seven Cataclysms pass underneath her? She was marveling at simply existing right now. The arena of the Burial Chamber was breathtaking, the huge black stone spires engulfing her like the open maw of a giant beast, lava surrounding her on all sides.</p>
<p class="cnM4MzFmMjc1NGZmYzRmYjI4ZTBmN2YxMTI1MmVlOTJl">There was a whole world like this to explore. What would the Sky-Pillar Range look like? The Ossuary Isles? The Gloamwoods? And a thousand other places that had been stunning even in the digital world, much less this higher fidelity one. What would the people be like?</p>
<p class="cnMwNTIwNWQ1ZTkyODQzYTI4YzZiNTZjNDBkNjYzZjZj">So, while inconvenienced, she didn’t find herself too upset.</p>
<p class="cnMyMjVhMTNhNmQ3MjQ3NWY5NWRkODE5NjRiMmFhMzhi">Logically speaking, it was better to visit a smaller city first, anyway.</p>
<p class="cnNiZjk0MjUzN2ZlMjRjNzRiMTI2NmVkZjViNGM1NDU3">“Off to Prismarche, then.” She dropped a [Warp Anchor], took a breath, then activated a skill. “[Gate To Nearest City].”</p>

## Chapter 2: 2 - Resurrection


                <p class="cnNjZjBkYjIxODg4MjRjZGFhZWRiZTY5NGJkNTM1YTk1">It wasn’t a spell, this time, but a skill, usable by even non-magic classes. She needed to draw no mana much less shape it. The skill worked by intent. Glowing white runes appeared on the ground, encircling her in a clockwise formation.</p>
<p class="cnNhMDQ0NTI5ZWVhODRjMGFhY2E4YTMxODAwM2Q3ZDdk">When the ten-second cast time completed, the skill flashed and activated.</p>
<p class="cnNiY2JjMmM5YWIxODQ1NTJhNjM3NGU3ZDM5N2JkMjA3">The fabric of space swallowed her up, chewed her around for a bit, then spat her out. It was an experience very unlike warping in Seven Cataclysms, and she expected she would need to get used to that. This world was merely modeled<em> </em>after the game she knew, not identical to it.</p>
<p class="cnM1MmNjODYzNjI2ZTRlYWVhZWJhNmNlZTdkZmIwZmJl">She stumbled a step as she reemerged into existence. Prismarche’s town square appeared in front of her.</p>
<p class="cnNiMTRjNWNmZjcyZTQzMzlhYjhmNDhhZDNlY2IyM2Fm">Many stimuli overwhelmed her at once. The bright morning sun filled a cloudless blue sky, forcing Vivi to squint as her eyes adjusted. It seemed her immense stats didn’t change basic human behaviors.</p>
<p class="cnNiNjFjYjVmYjVlZTQ1MTVhMzNkMWEzMTBjYjk0NjA4">Golden light washed across the stone square, illuminating a large town hall. Its bell tower rose high above the surrounding buildings, a huge clock face visible to everyone in the plaza. As if by divine timing, the massive hand ticked rightward, and the eleven o’clock bell chimed across the city.</p>
<p class="cnNiN2Q2YjY4NDlhMzQxYjU5NjY0NjM3ZGZkZTljMmM4">The space bustled with townspeople: officials hurrying into the town hall with scrolls, citizens gathered around the notice boards, travelers consulting maps on benches. While humans dominated the crowd, she spotted the pointed ears of elves in conversation, and the horns of demons, too.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTQwMTJhNWQ2NTQzMTNiNTE4OGNlYmMyNDJlMjdi">The world of Seven Cataclysms was full of all sorts of races, though Prismarche was decidedly human territory, so they were by far the most common.</p>
<p class="cnNhOGE4ZjEwNGJmZDQwZjRhY2NiOWNiMmZhMzBlOGUx">Colorful banners and decorative lanterns hung between buildings, and workers on ladders were stringing up even more. Several stalls were being constructed around the edges of the square as well, and there were other hints of presumably festival preparations underway. She’d arrived nearing a holiday.</p>
<p class="cnM1NWM4N2NmMjU1NjQ2YmM4NTAwMTVlNDI4ZmNmYzdl">Vivi turned to check behind her and froze. A set of statues stood there, the centerpiece of the town square on an elevated platform. The display featured five figures.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjg1NzA1M2I1ZTRmNTBiNzEyMDg4OWRmMmFjZTZh">Five figures she recognized. Because, eyes widening, she realized they were all people she knew. Her regular party members, the group she’d cleared most of the game with. Her friends.</p>
<p class="cnNmZWM2M2ViMWRlOTQ0MTFiMDY1NmNhMGU0M2JjMmQ4">Or, to this world, as she could read on the bronze plaque announcing the display: The Party of Heroes.</p>
<p class="cnNmNGQ0OGYzYTNiZjQ4ZGI4YmU1MWNhOWY1ZDU2MjZi">She gaped at the statue of herself in particular. Maybe she didn’t have much to worry about when it came to being recognized, because wow. They’d gotten her horribly wrong.</p>
<p class="cnNiZGY0ZTQxZjZlMTRkODdhZWUwMjk1MDBiYjc2ZDA4">The figure was clearly a female demon mage with curved horns, but that was all they’d gotten right. The proportions were way off: the statue was only slightly shorter than the rest of the group, presenting her as nearly six feet rather than the reality of four-foot-something, and her figure was all wrong. The statue was much more…womanly<em>.</em></p>
<p class="cnNlMTE0MjQ2YmRlYjRkNTY5OTBjNzVjNWUzYTQzNTk4">That soured her mood. Was it not heroic<em> </em>enough if she was short and flat? She’d designed her avatar that way for a reason, and her real-life self felt more than a bit annoyed.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTUxZmMxNjZhODQ0MDU5MTUzNmMyNWJmMjg0Nzdj">She guessed it was inevitable that a group of ‘legendary adventurers’ would be stylized into ‘perfect form’. Her friends hadn’t gotten the same treatment, but maybe that was because their avatars had already been impressive.</p>
<p class="cnMzYmFjN2E4OGE1YjQyYTBhZjIzOTYxNWEzZGM3YTg5">A pint-sized woman who might be mistaken for a girl didn’t fit the image of ‘savior of the world,’ so the designers had taken creative liberties. Ugh. At least it worked to her advantage. Since she’d hidden her facial tattoos as well, she ought to be able to walk around town without much trouble.</p>
<p class="cnMzMmZkODgyZmE2MTQ4NDY5YmI1MzNlYjAzOWJjMmI1">She still internally grumbled, though.</p>
<p class="cnM4YTI1NmQzNmZkYTRjYjdiZDZmZWVmMGFhZTgwMmE5">Somebody slammed into her from behind.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjZiMDRmYWNmYzQ1ZTU5ZWZlZmU0Y2MxYTA4OGI1">She didn’t shift an inch, but it still caught her by surprise. The man bounced backward, and Vivi jumped nearly a foot. She spun and backpedaled.</p>
<p class="cnMwYjYwYzdlZTkzNTQxMWFhMjZhNmNlNzNjMTljZjBi">A man sat there on the ground, wearing a baffled expression as he looked left and right, trying to find what he’d run into.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTY5YWJhY2NiZjQ3NjhiMTlkYWYzMjRhNDcyMDlm">Because right. She was invisible, standing in the middle of a populated town square.</p>
<p class="cnMxOWEwOGUzOGIyNjQwYzI5MzBlNDUyNjQyZDJhMjFk">Instincts urged her to apologize and help him up, but that would ruin her stealth mission.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjE1NGY2N2Y4ZDQ1MTQ5YmUxNjJjMzUzMDc0OWQ1">She internally vocalized the incantation, but felt the command word echo in her head.</p>
<p class="cnMxZmI4ZTI1ZDE0ODQzZTZhMDQ4MTY4NWFkMGRjNzY2">“[Fly].”</p>
<p class="cnMyOWRkMjU0NjExZjQwNzhhNjQ3MmQ4MGE2ZWQ5MDRh">As she rose into the air, the city of Prismarche spread out around her. Considering the sheer amount of hours she’d put into Seven Cataclysms, she had noticed that there was something off about the town square, and not just because of the statue in the center. As she gained enough height to take the city’s full breadth in, she came to a realization.</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2VkZWZlNDI1NzQ5ZmQ4ZDUyYWMzNGY5NTgyM2Q2">This wasn’t the Prismarche she knew.</p>
<p class="cnNlMjZlOGNiODM4YzQ0MTdhMzZiNmMzYTU1ZDUxYjJh">Not only was it much larger than it should be—something she could excuse as a consequence of translating a game world into a realistic one—but fundamentally, the city’s design was different. It was…more modern, she realized with a jolt. Still several hundred years behind Earth’s technology obviously, but the city was cleaner and newer than she remembered, more glass and better roads.</p>
<p class="cnNiZGViOGEyODZiMTQyMWNhOWNhMTRhMWUxYzlkOWU5">Off in the distance was the key offender. A train station with tracks snaking into the horizon, southward. There had definitely not been trains in Seven Cataclysms.</p>
<p class="cnMwYzEzZGFmMTJlOTQ3NDViMmM2YjhkOWExMzk4OGM2">The conclusion was obvious. Time had passed.</p>
<p class="cnM4YjEwNzgzOWViYTQyY2ZhZjQxNTZjZmY5NjQ4YjI4">How much?</p>
<p class="cnM0YWU4OWI5YjVkNTRlYzA5ZTVmZDUyYmI0YTgzMWU1">Enough to massively develop the city, introduce new inventions, and make rail travel common even to frontier cities like Prismarche. So not a few years…or even a few decades.</p>
<p class="cnNkYWM1MzJkZDEyNjQ2MjI5NmNlNzUwNDliYmMzNDNm">This was a world she was familiar with, but one that had left her behind.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDQ5OTM1ODFkZjRhOTA4MmE3NzM5OWEyYjNjNTAw">She had already known she couldn’t rely on her memories of the game, but that had just become doubly true.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjgxZTJmYzM1YTQ1NmJiMjJiMjAxNjkxY2Q5NmYy">For a while, she hovered a thousand feet in the air and took the city in.</p>
<p class="cnNiZDkxMTNkMzYzMzQ0ODJiOWI5OWU4ODc0ODQ3OWRh">What now?</p>
<p class="cnM1OGEzY2FiZDVjZjRiYWE5NTk3NjZhNTJlNzNlNjQ4">Her eyes landed on the outline of the city’s temple, a grandiose structure eclipsing even the town hall and bank, two of the other prominent buildings.</p><span class="cmIyZWU2NDdmYTE3MjQ0NjBhY2UxMzc2Y2E3Y2ZhN2Uw"><br>Taken from Royal Road, this narrative should be reported if found on Amazon.<br></span>
<p class="cnM2ZDg0NDJjODEwYzRiMjZhNDQwZmZmY2RiOGNjNmIx">The temple. That was her first stop. She needed to know if death was permanent, or if like in the game she would revive.</p>
<p class="cnMxMDhhNDZhNDc5NjQ5ZGM5YzRiOTI1Y2JhZTBiN2Zh">She ought to be close to invulnerable considering what account she was on, but knowing whether this was her only life would definitely change how she approached things.</p>
<p class="cnM1YTdjZGE1YzA5NDQwYzliMGNjYzkzMTZmODY4ZTJh">Not just for herself but everyone else too. She didn’t plan to become a mass murderer if murdering was permanent. Er…not that she would have wanted to go around slaughtering populaces anyway.</p>
<p class="cnNhYTViZWJjMGNjNzRjYjk5OTU3MzkwMTgyYzMyNzkz">Setting down in a nearby alleyway and dropping her invisibility spell, she strode into the street. She tensed slightly as she emerged into public for the first time, but most people paid her no mind, and the few who glanced her way didn’t seem to make much of her and quickly looked away.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGM1N2QzZDVmMjQ2MmU5MWMwMWRjOWRmOTgwNjUw">So she was inconspicuous. As she’d hoped. Though not completely. She was a demon in a human city. But she didn’t stand out to the point it would cause issues. More importantly, she wasn’t being recognized as the woman this city had a commemorating statue of in their town square.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGNmN2Q2YmMyZDQ3NWM5YjMzMDUyNTA1NGYzNDEx">Walking toward the temple’s entrance, a wave of vertigo hit her from the sheer surreality of her situation. When she’d been invisible and peering around, she’d felt like a spectator. Like despite the tactile realism she was in a game still. But having people all around her, hearing snippets of their conversations as she passed by, broke the illusion.</p>
<p class="cnMwZGZjMTcwMjI1NzRlODM4ZDRkY2Q2ODZjZDNlYTBi">This was her life now?</p>
<p class="cnNlZjFiYjM4MWZlZTQ2MDdhZjBmZmEzNzY4ZjEwNDRh">The enormity of that wasn’t remotely digestible, so she did what most people would. She blocked it out and focused on the here and now. She would have a mental breakdown later she guessed.</p>
<p class="cnMxMTNmMjRhYTZhMTQzYzc4ZjYyMjAwYmNjZTY5ODky">Not that she was too upset. She hadn’t been especially satisfied with her last life, and she hadn’t left anyone behind besides her online friends. And, well, she would miss them. A lot. But she had been pretty antisocial, and her parents were—not around.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZGE4ZTgyZTgxYTQ4YmRhZDQ5N2NlNDkxZjZmZWEz">Nevertheless, it was a lot to take in.</p>
<p class="cnM4YTJkYWE4MDA0YjRkYTZiMGVhODM1ZjVlNzUzMDAx">Prismarche’s Temple was a massive structure of polished white stone, with tall, arched windows of stained glass that depicted mostly unfamiliar images of saints and heroes. To her mild dismay one of the prominently displayed ones was of her and her group. The doors were open to all visitors, and inside, sunlight streamed through the windows, illuminating rows of wooden pews and a long aisle leading to a grand altar.</p>
<p class="cnMzNDY3Y2ViYjIyYjQ1OWFiMTE3YzZjMmNmMGU5OGQ0">Her eyes locked onto the nearest priest dressed in coarse gray robes.</p>
<p class="cnMxN2VlNmViYzNiODRhZTJiYzM5NGJiZjVmZjE5N2Ri">She urged her feet forward, but they didn’t move.</p>
<p class="cnM2MmY1OGJhOGMyYjQyN2Q4YWQ0YjllYjhkNWQ3NWQx">Being reborn into the body of her character hadn’t fundamentally changed her personality. What kind of person spent tens of thousands of hours grinding a popular video game to stand at the top of the leaderboards? Not social butterflies. Not someone who could gregariously elbow their way into any conversation and charm their audience.</p>
<p class="cnM2NDgxOGMyZDkxZTQ0MTQ4MWU3MmRiYjIyMmJlOWY3">Yet the anxiety that hit her wasn’t as strong as normal. Was it because she felt comfortable in the world of Seven Cataclysms? Was it because she was wearing a different body? She wasn’t Vivienne, shut-in and disaster. She was Vivisari.</p>
<p class="cnM2NTJkOGZkMWEzYjQ0YjZhNzVkMzY5OTUzMThhMmMx">She willed herself forward and her legs obeyed.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDgzOTFkNjg5ODRjMzc4OWUwOTM5M2FhZDcyMWU4">The priest was arranging prayer candles on a side altar. He was an older man with a weathered face and kind eyes that crinkled as he glanced up at Vivi’s approach. If he thought anything about her being a demon, his expression didn’t suggest it. His smile seemed surprisingly warm and earnest.</p>
<p class="cnNkY2MzZWUwYTgzODRkODQ5MmU1OGVkN2NkZmIwYzQy">“How can I help you, little one?”</p>
<p class="cnNmOWZiNzNjZjhhNzQyMDg5ZGM4ZDJkNzFmZWNmZTk4">Little one?</p>
<p class="cnNlMTA0ZGUzODEzNDRiOTk4MmIxYmFlY2UxZDU1ZWRj">She grimaced. That was why he had plastered on such a friendly expression. He thought she was a child and reacted with the appropriate gentleness.</p>
<p class="cnM4OGM4NzkxNmMzYTRiY2FhZWFkOGViZDc1MzMyNzkw">Really? An actual child?</p>
<p class="cnNkY2MyMmVkYWM3ODRmNWI5YWMzOWM3YTNiNDk1Zjk1">She sighed. It was hardly a new plight. As a young woman who was neither very tall nor particularly curvy—and she was being nice to herself with that description—it was inevitable strangers mistook her age. Constantly.</p>
<p class="cnNiODFhOWVkZTY0NjRiNjQ4MDZlNDRjMTJhNDE3OTUz">It was awful. Even as a twenty five year old, there had been plenty of instances where she had been pulled aside by people asking where her parents were. The death glare usually caught them up. Her voice at least wasn’t especially childlike.</p>
<p class="cnNmN2U1MmVjYTU5YjRlZjRiMGJkMzE0MmRkMjMzNTQ5">It was one injection of normalcy to steady her thoughts.</p>
<p class="cnMxZDdhZjUwOWFjMzRiOTliZTViNjBiMjA3NTBjOTNk">But seriously? ‘Little one’? She wasn’t <em>that </em>short. Well…in real life, she wasn’t. Vivisari, her avatar, had been designed even smaller.</p>
<p class="cnNmYjY5NDZmYjE1YzQ0MDFhZTUxMTJlN2ZhNDc1Mjhh">Oh no.</p>
<p class="cnNkYTA5ZDQxNDJjMTQ4OGViNWE4MTk3ZTdjMjI1ZTQw">Were people going to assume she was twelve in this body?</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTY1MWRhNjdiODQzNGQ5YTljODk4MGVhYTNiMDVk">Repressing another sigh, she got to the point.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzcwN2NlMDU4ZTRiODViMWY3NTkyZDBlMDFjNDI5">“I have questions I need answered, and I was hoping you could help.”</p>
<p class="cnM4OGFlNjMzM2QwOTRhOGQ5OWVmZTY3NTk0YTgxMmIx">The steadiness of her voice, at least, made the priest pause and visibly readjust his expectations. She wasn’t sure whether he recalibrated her age in his head, but his response didn’t take the same overly gentle tone.</p>
<p class="cnM1MDJkZWY2YjkyMTRhNTU4Y2NkMzM1NDI3MGFkOTZh">“Of course. What ails you?”</p>
<p class="cnNlZTIyYjU5NGRjYjQyNzE4NDY2YzBiMWU5OTllMTQz">“Is resurrection in any form possible?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNjQzZDBhMWViNDQzZWQ5ODVlYzcwZmVjOTZhM2Vk">Blunt and to the point. Open-ended in the case it was a phenomenon reserved to ‘players’. Though she had no idea if other players existed. At a minimum, her regular party was part of the world’s lore, as was her guild.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDJiYjY4MDY0MjQ4NmRhNjMzMTYxNmM2OWNhMmVm">The priest again reoriented, but this time at the unexpected question. A sympathetic look crossed his face.</p>
<p class="cnMyODQwODcyNDM5ZjRlM2RiYjZlMDdmNGUzODYzN2M0">She realized he thought she was asking for someone else’s sake, not her own.</p>
<p class="cnM2OGYwY2QyMTZmYzQ0Mjg4YjRkOWM3ODJjMDE2MTZk">“Even in the age of chaos, such magic was beyond mortals,” he said kindly. “Would the Sorceress, the supreme talent of magekind, not have revived her fallen comrades if it were?”</p>
<p class="cnM4MjE4NTY3OTYwNjRhYzRiYjUzNjRhYjM0YzdhOWNl">She blinked. “The Sorceress?”</p>
<p class="cnM4OTJiMGI4ZWFjYzQ5ZjZhYWU2ZWZlMDRlNjFkOTdi">He tilted his head. He clearly found it unusual that she didn’t recognize the title. “Vivisari Vexaria. The sorceress who adventured with the Party of Heroes and conquered the Seven Cataclysms.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MDFhM2ZkNjJjMzQxNmY5NWFlNTlkYmZiODBhOTY1">Uh.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTQ3MjY4N2E4NjQxMWNiZjMwNGFkOGMwMDVhNGZl">That was a coincidence. Then again maybe not. As he’d said, she was the highest tier spellcaster in the world, a figure of legend, so a question about high-tier magic like resurrection would easily tie back to her.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjgyY2RhOGU5ZDQwYzA5MTIyYWY4YjkzN2NlYzli">She opened her mouth and closed it.</p>
<p class="cnNhMDFhMGZiZmY5NjQ3Nzg4MGM4NjYwOGUwNzgyZmI1">So, dead was dead. There was no coming back.</p>
<p class="cnM3MTg1NjI3ODkyZTQyZmM4OTJmMTM0YjE2ZmNiYTcz">Also, her team was deceased. They were part of the world’s lore, but not alive and wandering about. She was likely the only ‘player’, at least as current evidence suggested.</p>
<p class="cnNhYmY1MDIzYjM0NDQ0YzBhMmQ4MGRiOGQ1ZDE2NWM2">“I see.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNTZkYWQ5OTNjNjRlZWViNThjZmNhOTI4ZDlmOTFi">She was quiet as she organized her thoughts. She had a million questions, but she also didn’t want to come off as too strange to this priest. Then again, did it matter? Secrecy wasn’t that important. She just didn’t want the whole world knowing who she was, not until she had her feet under her.</p>
<p class="cnM1OTE2Mjc0YWI4NTRkMjA5YTVmNGQ5ZTVkOTU1ZTMw">“Age of chaos?” she eventually asked.</p>
<p class="cnNmNGQ1MzI1NzA5MzQwMTY4MmUyZGVkZjVhN2EwMjNh">“Pardon?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNTUxYzViMTk5NjRmZGQ4ZjE2MmM1YzQyNjJkZGUx">“What is the age of chaos?”</p>
<p class="cnNiOGEyYWFhOWNkYzQ1ZjViNGFmNzI5NzZjNGMzNzQ4">His lips closed into a frown as he appraised her. “The age preceding the age of peace, of course. When the Cataclysms still tore through the world.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNTE4ZTU5YjAwYTRkMmI4YjkwZTk0MmE2NzlkYjQw">She could have deduced that, but it was better to have confirmation. The whole point of the game had been to defeat the Seven Cataclysms, and throughout the story’s campaigns she had done just that.</p>
<p class="cnNjODRjYzFjYTEyOTRmZTc4Y2RhODZhMzAzOTY0N2Fj">“What happened to the Party of Heroes?”</p>
<p class="cnMwODlkMGQ1NzY4YzQwMDVhZTU2YzcwNGJlMjY3M2E3">“Have you been skipping school, little one?”</p>
<p class="cnNmZTM4Zjg5NDk3NzQ4YjdhYjMyNTYxYjI0MWYyOTE3">That diminutive again. She gave him a flat look. “I’m a grown adult, sir.”</p>
<p class="cnNmODM1YjViMzhiZTQyYjlhNzg1OTA3MzU5NzRiMjM4">The priest floundered, which satisfied her somewhat. But he seemed like a decent enough person, so she didn’t make a big deal out of it. She was unfortunately used to this interaction.</p>
<p class="cnM0OTg3NTJmOGNiNzQ3ZTBhNzMwMTgwNjI4ZGRlZmYz">“My circumstances are…unusual,” she said. “I don’t know certain things I probably should. I would appreciate it if you humored me.”</p>
<p class="cnMyYmUyNzgwOThjZjQwODc4OWMzNTNlMWRmYjU4MTM3">“Indeed. Yes. Of course.” He smoothed his robes out, though they were perfectly straight. He was obviously gathering his thoughts. “The Party of Heroes?” he prompted.</p>
<p class="cnM0NjdmZjg5Y2Q5ZjRiOTBiNzRkYmViMzU1YTllOWY1">“Please.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMDA3M2ZkNTg0NTRmMTFhMTk5NmJlNTg3YjdkNDZh">“Though at great cost, with all but the Sorceress perishing in the fight, they triumphed over the seventh and final Cataclysm a hundred years ago nearly to this day. I’m sure you’ve seen the preparations underway?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNDY1MzNkZjdkMTQ5ZjFiNjA4ZmRlOTdkZmU2Y2Fj">A century. That explained the changed city and the advancements in technology.</p>
<p class="cnMxOTAxMDVmYWUyNjRkZDE5NDY4MDU5MmZkMDgzNDcy">“For the festival?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMWZiMmJmMGM5ODRlOGM4MWFlZjY5MThiOTA3Y2Nm">“Peace Day. Remembrance of our fortune, the end of the age of chaos and the advent of a kinder age. The celebration will last all week.”</p>
<p class="cnNkZTUxYjE2NDEwMTQ2MmI5NjBhMjEzODgyNWFlODZi">This next question was riskier, but she asked it anyway. “But the Sorceress lived?”</p>
<p class="cnM4MDUzMDhiNTNkNjRhZDNiYTJlZjYzZWQzZWE1Nzk0">Calling herself ‘the Sorceress’ made her internally wince, but apparently it was the title people used to refer to Vivisari.</p>
<p class="cnNmZGRkNmRjYjdmZjRhZGJhZTI3MDZjMmViZDM4MTUw">He nodded, and she followed up with:</p>
<p class="cnM3OTAwY2QyYzFlYzRhYzg4NmZmODIxZDFlODJhMWYx">“What happened to her?”</p>
<p class="cnMyNWEyZDg0YTM3MTQ5YjBhMjkxZTY0N2E4YmEyZTE4">“Only the heavens know.”</p>
<p class="cnNmNWFmMjBmYzU0MTQzOTE4NmJkMzk2ZTUxODFlYzA4">“Missing? But not dead?”</p>
<p class="cnMxYzAyYTYxOGNiZDQ5MGM4YmZlNDc3ZDUyM2I4MTk5">“Her death was never confirmed.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NGY1ZWE0ODRiNDQ4MWQ5ZDlhNGQ0YWIyNmFmNjdl">His tone implied heavily that he thought she was gone for good. She supposed that was fair. ‘Missing for a century’ was synonymous with ‘dead’.</p>
<p class="cnM2NDg4NzY5ZTkwZDQ4MjY5NzNhOTMzNWM5OTU2ZmQ1">“I see. Thank you for the help.”</p>
<p class="cnNjZGUyYTlhNGE0NTQxNDRhYzlkOTQxOGVjMzE4NmE5">The priest seemed surprised that she was ending the conversation so abruptly, but she turned and headed for the entrance.</p>
<p class="cnMxMTZmMjA0YmRkOTQ0MzQ4NTczYjcxZDQyOThkN2Nl">Out under the bright morning sky again, she came to a stop and organized her thoughts. Death was permanent. She was famous to the populace, but it had been a hundred years, and there didn’t seem to be a sign of ‘other players’. Even her old party was dead and gone.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTBmZGRlMmIxNjQ2NWU4ODVjNzMzNGY3MDY2ZWE0">Interesting…but not extremely relevant.</p>
<p class="cnM0NGFhYzY0MDVkMDQ5ZTBhMDIxY2JhNDJjMGYyNGY1">She didn’t have a single coin to her name. Her next stop was the bank. From there, she had no idea. Head for the capital city and see what had happened to her guild and item stash? But that would take time. It was a medium-term goal.</p>
<p class="cnM2NzI3MjcxOWEzMjQ4Yzk5YTEwNTY3YzRlZTgzM2Ex">Did she even have a bank account still? How had that particular<em> </em>game mechanic translated between worlds?</p>

## Chapter 3: 3 - Bank Account


                <p class="cnMyMzM3YTg2YzcwMTQ5ZWY5ZDQ1MWU4NDkzN2M1MGNl">With an empty metaphorical wallet, a visit to the bank was the clear logical first task to handle when lost in a foreign land. Money solved all sorts of problems—namely food, water, and shelter.</p>
<p class="cnM3OTkxZjIxZGIxMTQ3NWM5YmM1YTU2NDhlZWMxNGE3">Though did she even need to eat, drink, and sleep anymore? She was in the body of a mythical figure, and one pulled from a video game. It wasn’t like Seven Cataclysms had a sleep resource. Even food and drink were only for receiving beneficial statuses.</p>
<p class="cnM4OWRhNGUzYzlhNTRkMjU5MTRjOWRhYjg0MmYwMzc1">In any case, she wanted to know if she had access to her personal vault. In the game, she had been able to access both her money and several pages of item stashes through the bank system.</p>
<p class="cnNiZDg4N2E2NjNjODQ0ZDBiZjY4YmExNGY5N2JkNTE3">But as she’d seen, this world wasn’t one-to-one. And it had been a hundred years. She wouldn’t be surprised if her bank account had been closed by sheer dint of time.</p>
<p class="cnNmYWQwMTUwZmRiMjQ2YzA5OGM4YmNkN2Q4YWZmOTIy">There was only one way to find out.</p>
<hr>
<p class="cnNiNzQ2ZjEzMzZhYzQwODJiNTY0MmNkZTNjNmQ1NGNk">“Next,” Cyrus called, sparing a glance at the timekeeper on the wall.</p>
<p class="cnNkNmNkYzgyYzkxYjQzMDI4NDBjOTQxNDhhN2IyYmQ3">Two more hours to lunch. He’d had to skip breakfast, and he was feeling a bit ornery because of it, not that he’d let it show in his interactions with the customers today. This job was by far the most comfortable he’d had in a decade, and he had no intention of jeopardizing it. He could never know who exactly was stepping up to make a withdrawal, and all it took was annoying the wrong person to find himself in a world of trouble. He’d heard all sorts of horror stories over the years.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTNmNmI4N2FjZTQ4NjNhMjg4M2RkZjc3MmUzMWU1">A young woman was the next to step up to his counter.</p>
<p class="cnNiNDA0MzY2ODE5NDQ0MmM5ZWYwOTlhZTEzNTM4YjRj">Er, maybe not a woman? A girl? He wasn’t certain. She was a demon, and he knew those, like elves, aged differently from humans. They often seemed youthful when they were anything but. Centuries-old crones could be indistinguishable from adolescents. That said, this one did seem rather young.</p>
<p class="cnNlNzkxNTU2YjI5OTRkZDg5YTU1YTJjNjZjNGJlYzE2">She was dressed like a scholar or adventurer, in a thick black robe that went to the floor. She was paler than most demons, with curling black horns and straight white hair.</p>
<p class="cnM1YzFiNzMxNTYwNzRmNjNhOTg1MzZiZDFhZjA2Mzc1">She seemed to carry herself like an adult at least. Her red eyes were calm and assured, her expression relaxed—but not in a way that put him at ease. In fact, there was a general aura about her that gave him pause the longer he looked.</p>
<p class="cnMxYTQxNjcwZWIzNzRhN2E5OTUzY2Q5Y2I4YjZkNWIx">He still wasn’t certain whether she was a child, but he’d spent enough time working service jobs that he’d learned not to make assumptions. A certain incident with a mother and what he had been certain<em> </em>was her son haunted him.</p>
<p class="cnM3MTA2MDNiZWMxYzQxNGJiOTBjZmM4OTQwOGQ5YmQy">“How can I help you, miss?” he asked with the same level of professionalism he offered any customer.</p>
<p class="cnMxZTdmMTI5YTYwMDQ4YmViNzE3YWNiZmQ4ZmRmNmRh">“I’d like to make a withdrawal.” Her voice was flat, bored, and the tone erased most of his doubts. If this was a child, it was a strange one. He felt his spine straighten.</p>
<p class="cnMyNDI5NWUxYTYzZjQ5MDVhOTUyYjJlNzRiNTNkNDQy">“Of course.” He’d gone through this process a million times, so he reached under his desk and set the identifier in front of her before he consciously ordered his hands. “Please place your finger on the account identifier.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NDUzZWUxODFiNDQxMjQ5Y2Y2YmI1NzUzYzU2MWRh">The woman eyed the device.</p>
<p class="cnNhMDZhYmQwNTk1ZTQ5MGM4MDQxYjYzNzRkYmVjOTkw">“You do have an account with us, yes?” Cyrus asked.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzcyNWM5NWU0MDQyNTRhNTBhMWQzMDNiNGZkOWMy">“…Maybe?” she replied.</p>
<p class="cnMxZWE1MmM2NDExMTQ4ZTk5ZTJhN2FlZDJhZDU5OWNh">“Maybe?”</p>
<p class="cnNmOWYyOTBhNmRkMTRlOTBhZGJlMGRlNDY2NDBjNGM0">“I do most of my business in Meridian,” she said slowly. “Are the accounts linked?”</p>
<p class="cnMzNzBkMWJiMTQ3OTQ1MDE4NjQwZDZiOWJiYWIyZjk4">Meridian? She was a long way from home. He had to bite his tongue and repress his dubious tone.</p>
<p class="cnNhZTBkOGE0NzI3ZTQzNjY4NTAxODQzNjQ1YjE0NGIy">“Yes, Miss. The unified banking system is over three hundred years old and spans the entirety of the continent. Unless you’ve been banking with an unusual,” <em>illegal</em>, he didn’t say, “third party, if you have an account anywhere in the Kingdoms, you’ll be able to access it here.”</p>
<p class="cnM5MzQxZDM0NzE1YzQ3ZmY4YjFjMTBmMWJiOWYzOTBi">“I see.” She almost seemed like she was going to ask another question, but decided against it. She hovered her pointer finger above the small slate carved with runes, hesitated a second longer as if debating whether she should, and finally pressed it against the stone.</p>
<p class="cnNjMmM2MTUyNWNkNDQ0MmVhZDI3YWJkOTg5NTQ1Y2Uy">He’d honestly thought the projection screen that appeared would indicate she didn’t have an account. Her lack of familiarity with the system had once again changed his mind about whether he was dealing with an adult.</p>
<p class="cnMwMDNhNDc3YzNhOTQ1OTdiOWUzYmNjMGJlOWU5ZjRm">But a valid account popped up, mildly to his surprise, and it was filled with the usual sparse details: name, balance available for withdrawal, and a ‘notes’ section for any highly relevant details that a teller might need.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzY1MzU5M2Q1ODQ3MjE4YjkwMGE0ZjgzZjdjZjc1">Usually he read the customer’s name first to know who he was dealing with. But in ninety-nine percent of cases the ‘notes’ section was blank. So when there was text, his eyes fell there first.</p>
<p class="cnM0MmMxODJlZWQ5ZDRiYWJiYTNjNTNmMDAwYzFiN2Nm"><em>Presumed deceased. Account locked, but preserved for historical purposes.</em></p>
<p class="cnM4MTIxNGYxNjMyZTRiZmY4MzYwZGM1M2FhZDQwNDk1">He blinked.</p>
<p class="cnNjMzdkZGU2YjliNTRiYjViN2I4YjlmZDAxYjA3MGZi">That was strange. Very strange. He supposed he would have to submit a status update. Whoever this was, she wasn’t dead.</p>
<p class="cnMzOGY2ZDU2YjU1NjQ4NDRiYzMzZjEwOTIzOWE3YjJi">He’d never filed an account update form. He would need to ask for help.</p>
<p class="cnNkYjFmZGQ2Yzc2ZjRlYWY4MzBkZjRmOGE4N2Y4ZGUw">His eyes drifted upward, curious about her name, but they froze on the account balance.</p>
<p class="cnM2YWJlMGVkZDRlOTQxMGQ4OTQ0MTgwODQ5Mjk0MDMx">He blinked a second time. Then a third and a fourth. He took off his glasses, cleaned them, put them back on, and leaned forward with a scrunched brow to squint at the numbers on the projection to make absolutely certain he wasn’t imagining what he saw.</p>
<p class="cnM0MGE0MWMxYmUyZDRiM2ZhYmM4MWQ2OGRkOWQ2MDc5"><em>Available Balance</em></p>
<p class="cnNlYmRmMDNjMTc1ODRjMWFiYjY0NGI4MTFjNjcyMTg5"><em>Bronze: 62,242</em></p>
<p class="cnMwMmQ5N2RhMjE3MTRhNWNiMzM1NjE2YTRhYTg2ZDAz"><em>Silver: 258,550</em></p>
<p class="cnNmMzNkMTIxMjNjZTQ0OGE5NzE2YWY2YWI1ZTBjNGFh"><em>Gold: 33,239</em></p>
<p class="cnM2MjEzNWQ2MTBkODQ4NDc4ZjNjNjg0MGRhMDU3ZjFj"><em>Mithril: 8,812</em></p>
<p class="cnMwOTNhZGUwOTgwYzQ1MWNhMjQxODI1MWRmMzA2NWM3"><em>Orichalcum: 2,168</em></p><span class="cmRhN2NiMzNmOTMxMzQ4YWNiZjA0MjcwYjUzNzkzZDYw"><br>The story has been illicitly taken; should you find it on Amazon, report the infringement.<br></span>
<p class="cnNkZjliMTRhMTQ4ZjQxNTQ5NzllYTA5OWI4YjBlMTNj"><em>Starmetal: 128</em></p>
<p class="cnNhMjVkMDU5YzVjNDRjZmQ5MjM2NzdiMTk5ZjMyMTBm"><em>(Unified mynt: 49,263,642)</em></p>
<p class="cnM2ZTJjNTc0NzcxYzRkNmNhY2RhZmFlZmM1ZDY2ZDJm">He briefly lost all capability of reasoning. Ten seconds passed as he stared.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGYxYjZjZmI0YTRlZTFiYzc3YWQwNGFiNGY5MDFj">Was it broken somehow? The banking system couldn’t be broken; it was impossible.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTY5OTg3MzkyMTRiNDg5NTg1ODUyYjJjN2ZjNzc1">But one hundred and twenty-eight starmetal? Kings<em> </em>struggled to find starmetal in smaller quantities. He had never seen the starmetal field on a customer’s account display anything but zero. The wealthiest clients he’d interacted with might have a scant amount of orichalcum registered, but not a huge sum.</p>
<p class="cnMyZDZmM2Q5ODk2YjQzYWNiZTMwZmQ2MmY4MDNjNTdk">Not <em>two thousand</em> of it.</p>
<p class="cnMzMDliN2IyNDBjOTRjODZhYTMzMTQ1ZmMzOWM5NmE5">A meal might be a few bronze. A night at a nice inn, private room, a silver. A well-bred war horse, the sort upper-tier adventurers or nobility would ride into battle, fifty to a hundred gold.</p>
<p class="cnMwYWYzZWVhNmIxNTQ1ZmE5NzQzMjhlMzY3MGUzNDJi">Coinage went up in one to ten ratios. That meant a mithril was ten gold. Orichalcum a hundred. Starmetal a thousand.</p>
<p class="cnMwY2E0YTlhYTAwOTQwNDVhNDRmYmYyNDZjNmNiNDQ1">A small stack of starmetal could buy a damn fortress somewhere. It was the equivalent of <em>thousands of gold</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM1OWJkYjI0MzdjNTRkMjY5MmRjODAzNDgwNzUwNjM2">Almost dizzily, his eyes drifted to the top of the projection.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjY3ODZhYjg3ZTRjYWRiNjEwYWRlZjU1NGZlN2U3"><em>Vivisari Vexaria.</em></p>
<p class="cnNiYjIzNzI4ZDA0ZjQ1ODA4ODY2NDhkYzM5Y2RiYTNj">Then they slid back to the woman in front of his counter. Her red gaze was watching him warily, clearly reading his reaction.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDI1MjNlMzFlNDRlZmQ4YWE2OTUxNmRkYjAxNDBl">“Is there an issue?”</p>
<p class="cnMxNjVmNzlkMDg4YzRhZDc5NmZhYmVjY2JmZmY3NjA4">He opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="cnM4NzVmOWQwMTMwOTRmMzk5MTgzYTFmNjc3ZDYwNjYx">Closed it.</p>
<p class="cnMzN2RhYWJhOTc5ZjQ2ZTM4Zjg2OWEwN2UzY2YwODcy">Okay. This wasn’t actually<em> </em>Vivisari Vexaria. The idea brushed his mind for the briefest moment, but it was too absurd.</p>
<p class="cnMwOTgyOTQ0ODZmODRhZWNhZjZhMGQ0NTMwNWVkZGEw">Nevertheless, she’d fooled the identifier. That was nearly more concerning than the Sorceress actually reemerging into the world. The banking system was supposed to be impregnable. There had never been an instance of abuse or exploit. It was part of the Grand System itself. Not created by mortal hands, but the gods.</p>
<p class="cnMxYTgyOGY4NzZiODRlZjRiNWI5MmEzZjMyYWRhMmQx">It couldn’t<em> </em>be tricked.</p>
<p class="cnMxMjlhZDMyNmFhMjQ3NWY5OTE3YTdiNWYzMzdkODlm">Yet it had. Because this wasn’t Vivisari Vexaria.</p>
<p class="cnNiN2NlMGQ4MDhhYjRmNGM5ZTEzNWY3MDdhNTYxYTJk">Most blatant piece of evidence: she was way too short.</p>
<p class="cnNlM2NjNjg1ZmNlYjRiYjg4NzZjY2EyYTE5Njc0ZmE1">If this young woman had found a way to trick the banking system, why in the world would she expose herself this way? She could have pretended to be anyone, barring a handful of individuals, and he wouldn’t have thought twice. Because the system was infallible.</p>
<p class="cnM4NGVkMjUzODZkNzRhYjc5NjNmZjI5YjczYWJkZGI4">Sure, the account she’d gone after had a truly absurd sum in it, but he couldn’t pay it out if he wanted to. There weren’t coin reserves in the city to withdraw that balance. Certainly not enough starmetal. The High King’s vault itself surely didn’t have more than a few hundred coins of that precious material. And if she wanted to scam a smaller sum, why use <em>this </em>account?</p>
<p class="cnM4ODVjNTEyMzY2ZTQzOTI5ZjE0NWQ3NmUwYTJhOTk5">Was she not very intelligent? Ambitious to the point of foolhardiness? He supposed stories were full of that sort of thing. Idiocy was hardly rare, from highest station to low.</p>
<p class="cnMyZWU0ZjU3YjNiMjRjMzBhZDg3ZDQ2ODc4M2U5MTE3">She must have lucked into the exploit.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjg0MTJlNzg0ZjQ3Y2FiMzRhMjQwZTk3OTY0ODkw">She really was a child.</p>
<p class="cnMzNzg3YjVkNzY0MzRkMTI4MWMyMDRiY2I0Yzc1NjUx">But what did he do now?</p>
<p class="cnNhMzA2ZTM1MTM0MDQ5YmViMjU3Y2VkNDhiOWQ2YmQy">This was big. Outrageously so. The sort of thing he would be dealing with for weeks, in meetings with very important people he would need to tiptoe around. His day had suddenly gotten complicated. He felt a headache coming on.</p>
<p class="cnNjZjZjZDA0ODc2MzRkYTBhYzU3MmUyZDVhN2YwYTFk">He’d already been in a poor mood from missing breakfast.</p>
<p class="cnM2ODY5MjgwYzhhNjRkZjdhNjEyMGEwZWU2OWFmOWRi">His thoughts racing, he came to a decision.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzJjMzQyZTliMDRiNDI4Mzc1ODJhNTJhNzE3MjY3">“I’m sorry, miss,” he said. “I’m afraid you don’t have an account with us. Could you step aside, and we’ll get you set up?”</p>
<p class="cnNjYWRhMGM3YTlmYTQzYjM5OWUyMGEyZjQ2NDJmZWRj">He was taking a risk, but management would have his head if he didn’t try to detain her until he could call the guards.</p>
<p class="cnNjNGUyNGJhZWQ5NjRiZWU4NjdiYTllNTQyN2U0MTUx">“It said my name, didn’t it?” she asked flatly. She sighed. “Just—I don’t need much. Give me a hundred of each, up to orichalcum. It didn’t use to go through people, why are there tellers now? When did that change?”</p>
<p class="cnNjNWRlZTYzNjc5MzQyNjE5NmY4N2QxYTI1NDJlYzUz">She was doubling down. An interesting gambit, certainly. “I’m not sure what you mean, miss.” He put on his best blank face. His acting wasn’t horrible, seeing how he spent all day dealing with unpleasant folk.</p>
<p class="cnNmY2E4YTNjMDY5OTRiNjNhY2YyMWJlYWI2Yjk3M2Mw">He didn’t comment on the absurdity of ‘one hundred of each, up to orichalcum.’ As if that alone wasn’t a sum to make a king choke.</p>
<p class="cnNiM2EzNGE4NDg0MTRmMmY4ZWUxYmYzMzE0YWY3YjFl">The demon pinched the bridge of her nose, seeming irritated. “This was a mistake.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTVkNzlkZTVhMzQ0YzRhMzhjZDQyOGQ5ZGNjMWYz">He agreed. Really, what had she expected?</p>
<p class="cnMyYzllOGU1NThhNjQzNDA5OWYxYjY1NTJjZjVkZTQz">“Don’t report me to the guards,” she said. “Or anyone else. That would be…annoying.”</p>
<p class="cnM1N2ZjM2I4MGRlMDQ5MzhiZDc3NTUzZmNlMjMwOWE4">He paused. It was an audacious approach, just asking<em>. </em>But since he had no idea whether this woman was a high-level adventurer or similar, he wasn’t going to antagonize her.</p>
<p class="cnNiNGIzYWE2MzE4NzRlMDZhZDQ4NDc2ZTMyZjRmOGFj">“Of course, miss. I won’t say a thing.” Obviously, he had no hope of detaining her anymore. She knew what was going on. He wasn’t going to insist at risk to himself. He enjoyed his job, but he enjoyed his life more. So he would report her after she left.</p>
<p class="cnMwMTUwYjU2NTMxZTQyZjU5NjJhNDRiYTY3ZmFjMDA4">She stared at him. He supposed he hadn’t been convincing.</p>
<p class="cnMxNjk5YzA3NjY3ZTRkMzhiMDRlYzAzMGRiNGQzMjMy">“It is me, you know,” she said slowly. “You don’t think so, do you?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NzljZWZkOGI0NDRlZTNhYTY4NjcwM2E0NmFmOTRi">“I’m afraid I don’t know what you mean,” he said, lacking a more graceful option.</p>
<p class="cnNiZTU3NmZiNGY5YjRlY2JhNzQ4ZjdhZmE0NTk3ZmVl">She stared for another several seconds, and Cyrus shifted uncomfortably.</p>
<p class="cnNmNmMyNzE1N2I1NTQ1NmQ4YzlmNDhjNDQxNmU2NDIy">“I need to prove it, don’t I?” she said. “You’ll let me go if I do? With some coin?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MjJjODkyZThiNDRiOWRiOTUyNTAzNGVmNjBiMGI4">“The account is locked regardless,” he said, since there wasn’t a point in feigning cluelessness anymore. “I don’t want any trouble, miss, truly. I’ll forget this ever happened.”</p>
<p class="cnNjOTgzZWYyMTJlMjRlZWNiOTk4MjI3MGZiZTI4M2Ji">He was lying. An exploit like this threatened the fabric of society. If he couldn’t trust the banking system, what could<em> </em>he? He would report this event as soon as it was safe and feasible to do so.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZWQzZDI2ZWRhMDRjN2RiOGQ1ZWE2YTk5MzMwMDY3">“Fine,” she sighed. “I have to prove it.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMmYwYTAwZjA1YzQ3YzdiNTYxNTFlODE1NjZiZmY3">He grew worried all at once, but he didn’t have time to react before he felt that strange warble<em> </em>in the air that came with spellcasting.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTYyMWIxMTMwZDRhMWVhMWYyZTZhZTFlZjAzMGNm">Of the various classes, mage-types were the least common. Like most people, he’d given adventuring a try in his youth. Hadn’t been for him, as it wasn’t for most. But he’d been around enough magic to recognize that metallic tang in his mouth.</p>
<p class="cnMzZWNkNWIzZjQ2NDRlOWI4NDQ1MjJiMDY5ZmRkYWRh">“[Illusion].”</p>
<p class="cnNmOGNlNWQxMDZiODQyZDA4YTYzZmQyMDUzYTE3N2M0">“[Farsight].”</p>
<p class="cnNiMjExYmVhMDM3NjRjZWNhN2Y0YjUzZTU3YzU2ZDZk">“[Fly].”</p>
<p class="cnNkMWI1YjA1Nzk3NjQ5ZTJhNzBjM2JkNTQxYjgxNjY2">“[Blink].”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZjNjOTNlZGNlZDRmMzU5NWEwOTE1N2NlYzJmZTg0">The spells happened so fast he barely processed what was happening. One after another quicker than any mage should be capable of. Not that he’d been around high-rank adventurers often. Gold-ranks, on rare occasions.</p>
<p class="cnMwZWUyMTY2ZWI2NDQwNGZhZDY4YzhjOWZjMjY2Yjg3">But spells should have cast times. It was a mage’s fundamental weakness, what made them useful but specialized additions to a party. She activated them as fast as she could speak. Faster. It didn’t make sense.</p>
<p class="cnNiM2U3YTAxYTRiYTQ1YzY5ZDg5NjIwODZhNzcyYTZj">And then he was floating two thousand feet in the air.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDM3NjFkMTJjMjRkNjBiNDk5ZjVlY2IxNmIwYWQw">“Look,” she said, gesturing down at the city of Prismarche with a gnarled staff of gray wood. Her appearance had changed. The demon had red tear-trails running down her cheeks: the iconic mark of the Sorceress. Her robes were no longer black; swirling purple designs covered them. “Is this enough proof?”</p>
<p class="cnM0OTRmYWIyOWZjZDQxMWY5MmIwYjZkOThhMGUyMWJm">Cyrus considered himself a well-composed person. But this was too much. His mouth opened and closed like a fish’s.</p>
<p class="cnNjODBmYzQxYmMzZjQ4ZWM4NjUwOTZhN2FhYTY1N2U5">She sighed. “Not high enough tier magic? Fine. [Blink]. [Blink]. [Blink]. [Blink]. [Detect Presence].”</p>
<p class="cnMxMzU5YjM5MzE4YjQ1ZmFhMmQyNzAwOWJlNDc5OTUy">And then they were hovering a thousand feet over the wilderness, the urban expanse of Prismarche no longer visible, only endless pine forest, the snow-capped mountains many miles away.</p>
<p class="cnNkNmQ5NmEwYjQ1ZjRlOGNhMjhmMmIwOGNlMTM3ZTlh">The demon pointed her staff down toward the forest. He felt magic gather. <em>Real </em>magic, though what he’d already experienced eclipsed anything he’d ever seen or felt. Teleportation was already the domain of mithril-rank adventurers <em>at least. </em>He wasn’t even certain of that. It might be much higher. It was so high rank he simply didn’t know.</p>
<p class="cnNkYjc2NzQ0OWUyMzQyNGI4YjcwNTExMTQxYjM2NTIx">Whatever spell she was forming, it didn’t just put a metallic taste in his mouth. It wobbled the jelly in his eyes; his throat closed; a dull pressure ached in his skull, growing by the second.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDc0ODY0Y2M2ZDQ0M2ViYWJlNmE5N2M5ZjI0NTM4">He felt very, very small all of a sudden. A glowing magical circle inscribed with the densest, brightest runes he’d ever seen formed in front of him. He could practically taste the magic it radiated.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZjExOGNjZTlmMzRlMWRiOTM4YWM5ZTFkODA3NmY3">What would happen when that monstrosity of a spell finished?</p>
<p class="cnNiZjA5MDMzNmFiMTRjMWU4N2I5MTE4MDQzZmJkOGRl">Just what in heaven’s name was she casting?</p>
<p class="cnM2NGY1MzE0ODAwNTQzMjk5MTJjMjZjMTQxYTRjMjFl">The spell named itself more than she named it. It fell from her lips with enough power to make a dragon tuck its tail and flee.</p>
<p class="cnNhODRkM2ZjYWYzNzRmZTg5NDZiNmU1MGUyZGIyZjI3">“[Kaelum’s Thousand-Year Pyre].”</p>
<p class="cnM2ODdiN2FkYzM1MjRkYzU4ODkzMjU1MWM4YTFiZTY2">The heavens split. A column of white fire descended. It impacted the ground and disintegrated everything in a quarter-mile radius. The heat washed across him despite the great distance. He covered his eyes with one hand, else he might have been blinded.</p>
<p class="cnNiZWFmN2MzNmU3OTRiYjM5MzAxNTViMDNiMDI5Mjdh">When the spell finished running its course, there was nothing remaining besides earth turned to glass.</p>
<p class="cnM2OTcwMjg2NmJkNzQ5YzZhNTlkZGJiZGFkYmE5ZTQ4">He stared dumbly.</p>
<p class="cnM3NzVjZGFmMTMyNDQxNmI4OGRmYTllYjQxYTUxMmQz">What…what tier spell had that been?</p>
<p class="cnM0YWJiNDNiM2U4MDRiYzY5NmY5MzYyNzQ0ZjUxMjU1">He couldn’t comprehend what he’d seen. Floating in the air was surreal enough. Flight was already a rare enough spell he’d have been cowed.</p>
<p class="cnMzNjdlOGU4YTFhMzQ1YzE4NTIxNTZlYWQ1MzNkYzZi">That…whatever it had been…was too much. His brain simply stopped working.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGQ1ZWRiMmZhNjRiMDI4MTcwNzhmZDNiMTE1MWI1">“See? It’s me,” the demon said, still sounding mildly annoyed, as if she was dealing with a somewhat irritating haggling process, and hadn’t just evaporated a swath of wilderness by whim. “But I’m here on private business, don’t report me to the guards. Now, how do I unlock my account?”</p>

## Chapter 4: 4 - Adventurer's Guild


                <p class="cnNiMjFkMDBjZWYxNzQxNjZiYmIxYWM0MzliYTdjY2I5">Vivi returned the bank teller to his place behind the counter, dropped the [Illusion] she’d used to hide their disappearance from other customers, and immediately felt bad about what she’d done.</p>
<p class="cnM3MDBiOTgxYjQ2NjQ5MTc4YjRkNTI1OTZhZTYzZWI0">But what other choice had she had? She needed him not to run off and tell the guards about her. On top of that, she needed to know how to access her account—assuming it really was locked.</p>
<p class="cnMwNDZlOWFjODNhNDQ3YWU5MjcyMmQxMGJjOGU4YjU5">How else could she prove, quickly and reliably, that she was who she said she was except through an explosive display of magic?</p>
<p class="cnNhZmZkNTA5ZTAwNDQ4ZTU4YTQxMTRkZTVmODBjZGFl">Admittedly, she’d been curious what the extent of her magical strength was too. She might have seized the first reasonable excuse for casting a high-tier spell.</p>
<p class="cnM3MTEyZjE0MGFhNTQyMTZiZWE5NDk3NjA5MmJiYTg1">It had been…impressive. To say the least. She was used to casting similar spells in the game of Seven Cataclysms, but the realism changed everything. She’d felt that explosion in her bones. It had rattled her entire skeleton and lit up the world around her. She’d purposefully blinked an enormous distance away, into the deep wilderness far out of range of Prismarche and nearby cities, but even with that precaution, she might have alerted someone.</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2MwZmZjYjdjNzQ3YTFhNzg3NzYxN2I0ZTA0ZjVl">Regardless, she felt bad about what she’d done. Because the teller was shaken, his face pale and his knees wobbling.</p>
<p class="cnM0NWQwMGY5NzkxMjRlYzU4ZWZlMmRhNjk0OGFlYWVk">Which was a maybe fitting reaction to being kidnapped and forced to watch a strange woman—a figure of myth—disintegrate a small section of wilderness with a wave of her staff.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWNiODc4YTk5ZjQ1NmJhODY0M2RkZmEzZmJlOWFh">Thankfully, she had a spell for this. She had a spell for most things.</p>
<p class="cnNiMmNkMWQwMzA4NTQ2YTdiYWY0ZTVmZGY3MjgyNmRm">“[Calm].”</p>
<p class="cnNkMTI3YmRjYjliZDQ5ZmRiMWNkNWQxNWMxYTdkNDZk">Mental magics were a whole branch of the arcane, and naturally her character, Vivisari, was well-versed in them. There were few branches she <em>wasn’t </em>comfortable with.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjM4NmUzYTA5ODQxZDI4ODdkOTA2ZmI1NWJmNDQ2">She could have erased his memories entirely and skipped all this nonsense, but that idea disturbed her, hence she’d taken an alternate path. It seemed like the sort of line she shouldn’t cross. Though this was<em> </em>the world of a video game she once played, it was clearly real life, and these were real people. Messing with someone’s memories or free will was wrong.</p>
<p class="cnNjNWUwMzI3NTM0NTQxMDJiMTk1NGFiNDMxMDIyYzkw">A spell to calm someone down didn’t feel like it counted. It might be a borderline case since technically<em> </em>it was mental magic, yes, but it didn’t do anything more than sitting down and taking some deep breaths would. The teller certainly wasn’t cured. He just didn’t seem hysterical and ready to flee anymore.</p>
<p class="cnNmMDlmNWIyZDMyMzRlMTE4NDEyMmM0MTE0MzhlNDQw">His knuckles were white as he gripped the counter top, leaning on it for support. “I apologize for any…slights…you feel I offered, Lady…Vivisari.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNjQzNzM1MWJmZTRkNGRhOTIyNGZkMGUyMjc2MmY5">His shaky words weren’t helping her feel better. If he was this rattled after a calming spell, she’d left an impression.</p>
<p class="cnNiM2ZlYjc5OWQ4YzRlNTRhNWNmOTc3ZDU4MTg2ODky">“It’s fine. Is my account really locked?”</p>
<p class="cnMzMTdhOTZiYzMzYzRhNWVhZjk4YWQ3NWQ0MDMwNGM4">He nodded rapidly. “But it was preserved. Your funds are still available. You’d simply have to speak with someone with higher-level access to the banking system to remove the lock.”</p>
<p class="cnNjYjUwODVjYWRjYjRkMGY5ZmQ2ZTNkYjM4OTFiODU4">“Who?”</p>
<p class="cnM3MmU1OTVkMGJiOTRjNzhhNDQ5MzhkYjRjMDExNjll">He hesitated. “For a case as important as yours? Likely the Chief Banker himself, in Meridian.” He seemed extremely worried that she would be upset by that answer.</p>
<p class="cnM0ODM4MDBkOGRkZTQ1NTFiYjE2ZmMzZjZhOGM1YmQ4">She was annoyed, but more at herself for having terrified some random service worker. And, admittedly, irritated at the situation itself. She was seriously barred from her account?</p>
<p class="cnM4YzBlZTFmMzU2ZDQxMzk4YTc2NGFmZjk5YTg0ZGVi">“I see. I intended to head that way regardless, I suppose.” She waved a hand dismissively. “As I said, I’m here on private business. Please don’t spread the word.”</p>
<p class="cnNjYzg5YzM4NGNkNTRhYWFiZGVhOWRlYzcyMGMwYmEw">He practically fell over himself in his rush to assure her that he wouldn’t, and she left the bank feeling slightly gross with herself. She’d definitely gotten too caught up in her ‘proof of identity’.</p>
<p class="cnNhOGE4M2ZhODc0YzRjNjliY2E4NzFkMTFiZGM0M2Qz">…The explosion had been really cool though.</p>
<p class="cnMxNmViNzdhOThkYjQ4ZWJiMDMzYmYzMzE1MGY0Yjc2">Back out in the daylight, she reevaluated her plan of attack.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzI2OThlNzY1MTRmZjQ5ZDE3ZGRkNWIyNTQ2ZTlj">It had been too much to hope for to simply withdraw the funds she needed. Nothing was ever easy. That said, it couldn’t be difficult to make some basic coin, not as a level two-thousand plus mage.</p>
<p class="cnMzMTkyZGQzYjIzZDRjYTA4Y2E2MWRkMWIxN2E0MTU1">Heck, her inventory might be mostly empty, but she had a set of healing and mana potions she could pawn off, right? That would be an easy way. She hardly needed a mountain of riches, just enough to buy food and a place to sleep. And also a Greateagle flight—or a train ticket? Which would be faster? The train would be the more comfortable of the two, at a minimum.</p>
<p class="cnNhNWI1ZDg2NTQxMTQyZjNiMDczNzY1YTdhNzYwZjgz">Pulling up her inventory, she tapped the square holding her health potion and withdrew one. The flask was wide and triangular with a fat base.</p>
<p class="cnMyZWFiMTcyNmY3NzRmMjhiOWUzY2RkZTVlZTJjZGNm">She sloshed the potion back and forth, watching the liquid inside swirl and crash against the glass in a fascinating way. The fluid seemed much more magical when disturbed, changing hues into various shades of sparkling red and orange.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDUxYTJmY2MyMTQ0MjBiZmY0Nzk0YmE2ODRiNzM2">How much would one of these sell for? They were the highest-tier health potions she’d been able to buy, meant for her challenge runs soloing the Ashen Hierophant on mythic difficulty. They had to be valuable.</p>
<p class="cnM5YThmNmUxNDM4NTQ5ZWJiMDUwY2MwZmI5YWJlN2E5">But even she had a limited supply. Maybe she shouldn’t sell it. Again, she only needed enough coin for basic food, shelter, and miscellaneous needs.</p>
<p class="cnNiN2YzMzE2OWE0ODQzYTU5NDY5Y2Q3ZTk1YWM4MTli">Not really thinking, she tugged on the cork and popped the potion open, curious what it smelled like.</p>
<p class="cnM2ODk1NWM3NTQyNzRmYjNiZjg4OGMzYjhmODM2M2Ni">Honey, mint, and cinnamon. The scent was instant and pervasive, but even more noticeable was the way magic <em>gushed </em>from the vial. It was a palpable thing it was so dense, even to her resistant magical senses.</p>
<p class="cnM5NTBjOWUzOTU5NjRmMTFhOGVlZjJiNWMyZTc2YWM5">Fumes drifted out of the thin neck of the flask, settled onto the cobblestone, and weeds began sprouting from the cracks, green foliage appearing from nowhere, growth spurred on by the immense regenerative properties held in even a whiff of the potion. She hastily capped and inventoried it, looking around to see if anyone had noticed. No one had.</p><span class="cjQzNDUwMGEzNzljYzRmMzc5ZGM5ZjZkMjk4NDFiOGNi"><br>This content has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road; report any instances of this story if found elsewhere.<br></span>
<p class="cnNhMzJmMjc3YTc3MDQ4NzNhZWY3MjJjYWE3MGZmNGEy">So, uh, yeah. Probably too valuable to pawn. The same went for her mana potions and other challenge-run consumables.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTMxMzI2OWRmNTQwNzFhM2RiMzI3NDFhMDU1ZWMy">Well, fine. There was always working for a living.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTI1MGMzNWI2ZDQ5ZGY4ZTQ0M2ZiZjk4OTM2Y2Fi">She meant the Adventurer’s Guild, of course. She was looking forward to experimenting more with her abilities anyway. A hunting trip was in order. Two birds with one stone.</p>
<hr>
<p class="cnM4Mjc0N2U4YjI1NTQ4M2ViZmEwMzJjMGY4NzA1MmMy">She was still getting used to being in a fantasy world. Being around everyday civilians was already surreal. Stepping foot into the Adventurer’s Guild and being met with humans, elves, demons, and even a dwarf, all of them dressed in varying sets of armor—platemail and flowing robes and leather cuirasses—was another matter altogether.</p>
<p class="cnMwYWZjNDA1NDdmNDRiZjNhZThlMGUxNjNhZmYxM2Yy">Everything was so <em>vivid </em>and <em>real</em>. She hovered at the doorway, taking it in, before someone cleared their throat to remind her that she was blocking passage in. She hurried forward, blushing slightly, which probably didn’t fit the image of the legendary sorceress, Vivisari Vexaria.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZWRlZWU3ZTNmMDRjZWM5YmNjNTUzYzM4OWU3ODkz">Though, the blush didn’t touch her cheeks; it was only in her head. She’d never been an especially emotive girl, and Vivisari’s body was even slower to show reactions than her previous. She had been calmer and more composed than ever, externally speaking, through today’s encounters. That said, she felt awfully like a tourist the way she gawked around, even if another person would simply see her coolly surveying the space with bored eyes.</p>
<p class="cnNjZjdlN2UxN2YxZjRmNWRiOGEwYTZkMDdjNDdmZDQ1">Her gaze drifted from one adventurer to another. Most wore a small, metallic emblem pinned to their chest. She saw mostly bronze, a few glints of silver, and a rare flash of gold on the handsome blond knight standing by the board. It was clearly some sort of rank identifier.</p>
<p class="cnMzNTU3ZmM2MDE4ODQwOTg5ZjcxZmVmYzE2ZmEyNGI1">She spotted the receptionist’s desk, a sturdy wooden counter tucked to the side, and headed for it.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTA4NjhhYTZiZDQyOWRhODQ5MzI2YmFkZTU5ZmYy">The receptionist was a human woman—Vivi felt weird that she needed to make the clarification of ‘human’ inside her own head—with twin brown braids. She was pretty, slightly plump, and seemed like the sort of person who would normally be wearing a friendly expression at all times, but right now she seemed ill, leaning against the counter heavily and obviously wanting to be in bed rather than at work. As Vivi approached, the woman forced herself to perk up and plaster a customer service smile on.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzA4MmM3NzA1ODRiZDFiYWViNmY4YmQxOTE5MTQx">Vivi couldn’t help herself from asking, “Had an interesting night?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZWRlN2Y3MmYzNDQ3MmY4OGY2MDgxMTk0NDgzYTYw">It was just too obvious. She’d been there. Not that she overindulged often, but she recognized the signs.</p>
<p class="cnM3Yjc4NjA2YzljYTRjYWVhYzg1NjQzMzM1NDRkYjIw">The receptionist winced, then let out an apologetic chuckle. “That obvious? Yeah…festival started a little early for me. Once in a century opportunity to celebrate. Why not, right?” She took a breath. “How can I help, miss?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NTBiNTYwMWJjYzQxYWU4YWM1YWI1ZTM5Zjk3MjNk">At least she wasn’t calling her ‘little one’ or eyeing her dubiously as if wondering whether she belonged there at all. Of the three interactions she’d had, this was her favorite by that fact alone.</p>
<p class="cnMzNGFlNGE2ZDVkZjQ4Yzc5N2FkYmFiZDg5NDBmMGRj">There was a recurring issue she was running into: being reborn into her character had given her a wealth of knowledge on sorcerous topics, but no intuition for any of the other facets of this world. Meaning she was missing a lot of common knowledge.</p>
<p class="cnMyOTc1NjcwZjFkNTRmYjQ5ODcyZjAwZThiNWNkZjI4">She knew she wasn’t going to remain anonymous for long. Extensive efforts were pointless. Twenty minutes ago she had teleported a man into the wilderness and exploded a quarter mile with the wrath of the heavens themselves.</p>
<p class="cnNmOGNkZjE3M2VkYTQ0MDdiNjAyZDlkYzYzYzZlNjNl">So she asked with a total lack of grace, “You buy monster parts here?”</p>
<p class="cnM0MDgxYTBhN2ZmYTQ1ZDlhNzYzNmI0MWEyMmFkMDQ0">The receptionist oriented herself to that question. Likely, the Adventurer’s Guild was as much of a staple to society as banks were. Vivi’s question was the equivalent of walking into a grocery store and asking if they sold food.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDU3OTZlNGJmZjRjMTk4N2RiNmZiNTJkNmE5ZjFm">Put like that, she winced. She could’ve asked something less suspicious even if she’d given up on flying under the radar.</p>
<p class="cnNmODEzNWQ1MTM0OTQ4NjQ4M2I2ZWZkMjRiODI0ZDBm">“Er, yes?” the receptionist said. Her name tag read ‘Danny’. “Don’t think our evaluator is busy if you needa appraise some parts. Should I go ask?”</p>
<p class="cnNkYWZlODIwOGQyYTRhOGQ4Yzg2MDY2MDRjODIxZjI4">She’d generously interpreted Vivi’s question as if she were seeking an appraisal instead of literally wondering if the Guild bought monster parts. That was fortunate.</p>
<p class="cnNlN2VmYWY4ZTNjNjRiNWM4NzEwODRmZWIzOTM3MjA1">“Not right now,” she said, her face not betraying her embarrassment. “But probably soon. It’s by appointment?”</p>
<p class="cnM0NjQ5NTc3MzhjMDRhOGQ4MmU3OGJjNGRjYmYyZGFl">“Don’t get enough traffic for that,” she snorted. “But we can set one up if you want. From a big city, are you?”</p>
<p class="cnNmMWU3MDY2YzJlMTQxOWFhMGE1YTA5MDFiODRlYWIx">She’d have thought Prismarche was large itself, but she supposed by the standards of Meridian it wasn’t. Prismarche was far, far to the north, set in a relatively dangerous part of the Northern Kingdom. It was by no means some tiny city, but even in the game it hadn’t been a twentieth the size of the capital of the Central Kingdom.</p>
<p class="cnNjYTkxZTU2NDMxZjQ4OWViMjY1NmNlMWE4YjhiMTg1">“Meridian,” Vivi said.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGI4ZGU3YzZhMjRkZDNhYTYwMTgxNTBhMmE2OTQy">Danny’s eyebrows shot up. “From <em>the </em>big city. Heard good things. Been wanting to head down that way myself, but—” She waved a hand. “Bit of a ride, to say the least.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMTU5MzEzZmE5YzQyMjg4OWNhYTc4Mjk5NTJiODU1">Vivi nodded. The conversation slowed.</p>
<p class="cnM4YjY0MGRjYjdlZTQ2MzdhZDMxMzRiNWU5NDQxNjkw">Oh, jeez. Was she supposed to comment on Meridian, now? Small talk. Not her specialty. Better to launch into her next question.</p>
<p class="cnNhNzM4OWM4MjJiNTQwNzk4NTZkMDE5MDQ4YjNlMjg1">“The badges everyone is wearing. On their chests.” She tapped the location on her own. “Those are…ranks?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NzQ4ZDQwNWQxYjQ1ZGY4YTM0OTBkYWYyODFkMmZk">Danny’s reaction was even more doubtful this time. “Y-Yes?”</p>
<p class="cnM2OGRhYTE4OTE3MzQxNWU5MTY0NjhhNzA3ZTIwNjcx">“How do those go?”</p>
<p class="cnNmYmI1NTZlNTk0OTRlNzVhYjgyNzQxYTYxZDAxMzE1">Danny’s mouth opened and closed, but she replied nonetheless. “Same as coinage. Bronze, silver, gold, mithril, orichalcum, starmetal. Though most people call starmetal ranks ‘Titled’, on account of being given official titles and all. Never seen one myself,” she added, in that same conversational tone, but Vivi could tell she was talking on autopilot as she studied her with growing curiosity.</p>
<p class="cnNkMmRjNWYzYTNkODQzNGRhMTQzYzY0M2FlZWQzODkw">“And how does ranking up work?” she asked, barreling forward without concern. What was the worst that would happen? The receptionist went around gossiping about a strange person who had shown up in the Adventurer’s Guild? That had to happen all the time.</p>
<p class="cnNhMGU0OWNmNTE1MzQzOWZiOTY3OTI1MmYyODMzNjk2">Again, Danny clearly found the question odd, but she answered. “You start at bronze, and when you hit level two hundred, you automatically qualify for silver. Gold and up takes approval from a guildmaster. You need enough quest points, a review of your missions, and to pass the exam. It’s not just about being able to blast your way through everything. It doesn’t matter if you killed all the monsters if the town was destroyed in the process. The upper rank badges are a mark of prestige for a reason, and it’s about knowing how to act with discretion as much as knowing how to kill things efficiently.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZmVkODBjOTI5MjRmM2JhMGQ1ZTYyYjIzYjE3OWZm">“I see.” She kept a straight face, since that was her only defense. “As far as selling monster parts, are there rank restrictions?”</p>
<p class="cnNiYmJiY2IzNmQyNjQ1YmM5YjkxYjYxOTkwOGY3NWNm">She’d been curious about how ranks worked, since they weren’t present in Seven Cataclysms, and thus one of those changes she’d been taking special note of. But selling loot was her real end goal. She needed to make money, and killing monsters was the easiest way—at least, the easiest least suspicious way that also let her experiment with magic more.</p>
<p class="cnNiYTRmZTgxMTgwZTRjOTM4MmFiZDk0ODg4MDU0ZDFh">“Um,” Danny said for the hundredth time, telling Vivi how strange this interaction was to her. “No. There are rank restrictions on quests, but if you have monster parts, or other loot, our appraiser will give you a fair deal. You might be able to squeak a little more coin out walking through town and selling stuff individually, but the Guild pays fair from what I’ve heard. Not the best, but fair.” She shrugged. “I ain’t going around and selling Briarhoar Spikes myself, so I can’t say so for sure, but I haven’t heard complaints.” She laughed. “Not ones I put value in, at least, since people will complain about anything. Our prices are fair.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMWI4YmJjZTBkODRhNTRhODEzNTJkNjdmN2ViZDNm">“That’s all I needed, then. Thank you.”</p>
<p class="cnMwODQ5NDBhYzMzMzRjNWI4ZjFmMGUwOTk5ZDM3YjU0">“My pleasure?”</p>
<p class="cnNkZTMxMWQwZDFhNjQyYTI4NWY4ODhkNTQwNmU2Mjc0">She turned and strode confidently away. Incredibly, her cheeks still weren’t burning. Her embarrassment seemed confined within herself. This new body was good for a few things, even if it created more doubts to her age than even her last.</p>
<p class="cnNlYmRiZDljZTg4ODQyZDRiN2Q3NDc3MmI5MWQ4YjUx">Her target was the quest board. She didn’t think she would be taking any of them, since she would have to register first, and killing monsters and selling whatever she got seemed easier anyway. But she was curious what they said, so she might as well while she was here.</p>
<p class="cnNiNmQ5YjQ0ZTgyZTQ4YWY5MzE2NjI2YTZlNjVlNDZi">Unfortunately, she was intercepted halfway to the board.</p>

## Chapter 5: 5 - Offer


                <p class="cnM1ZDJkZGE2YTQ3NzQyNGNiNmU4NGI5MzIxZTQ2M2Fi">The woman who intercepted Vivi had green hair, which wasn’t all that unusual in the world of Seven Cataclysms. Brown and black <em>were</em> the most common, but there were brighter colors added to the mix beyond blonde and red. She was tall, skinny, and wore light leather armor suggesting a rogue class.</p>
<p class="cnMwMjA2MDFhNzQxNTQ1ODhiMDNlZmM5YWM3MGZiNDE3">She smiled in apology for interrupting. “Sorry. Don’t mean to bother, but I caught the tail end of your conversation. You’re new in town? Didn’t mean to eavesdrop, just couldn’t help it—I was sitting right there.” She gestured at a table where a broad-shouldered man with a scar across his eye was sitting; they were only a dozen feet from the receptionist’s desk. On Vivi’s attention turning his way, the man raised a hand in acknowledgment. She nodded in return.</p>
<p class="cnNhNGJiYTkxYWIyMjRmM2NiMjg3OTdmZDZkNWU3ZjNm">“Yes,” Vivi said slowly. “I just arrived.”</p>
<p class="cnNkZTQxYWUxYTkzMTQ3NTM4Y2I4ZGJmNDY5ZDMxN2Ez">“And you’re not registered with the Guild. That’s not rare, you know. The Guild is where almost all of the edge cases turn up.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMzAyM2EyODFhMTRjMThiMmJmMjgxOTVkNTM3MTg5">Vivi wasn’t sure how to reply to that, so she said nothing.</p>
<p class="cnM3OWQzMjEzNWRiNzQ4YmFiNDY1MzU3Yzc0YjgxMThi">The green-haired girl laughed. “Sorry, I’ll get to the point. We’re trying to fill out a party. We’re here for the festival—like you are, maybe?—but of our group, only me and Dom wanted to head this far north. Even though Prismarche’s festival is supposed to be the best in the kingdoms, being the final destination of the Party of Heroes and all that. Rest of our team was too lazy. Can you believe them?”</p>
<p class="cnNmZGY2YTMyNGJkODQyNjVhYTM1ZjE3MDBiYzRkYjNh">Vivi had never done well with the social butterflies. “Right,” she said, not intending to sound cold and reserved, but the single word probably came off that way.</p>
<p class="cnNiOWZmMzI3YzIzMzQ2MDliNWRlYTM1ZWVmYjZhZmEy">The woman cleared her throat. “So, just wondering if you wanted to join us for an expedition,” she said, her smile wiping away, but not in an unfriendly manner. “Just for today. You don’t have an official rank, but what level are you, if you don’t mind sharing? Or roughly where do you stand? We’re both mid silver.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YjQ2NTc0Nzk0MzQ5YWZiMzg0MzI5NjllMGU5ZWJm">Vivi mulled over her options, eventually deciding to lie. “The same. A little higher, perhaps, I’m not certain. Still new to this.”</p>
<p class="cnM1ODQxZjYzYjAxYTQwYmVhYzA4ZjUzODQ2Zjg0NWFi">“Of course,” the green-haired girl said smoothly. “Oh. Lailah, by the way. Good to meet you.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MWYzNDg4YmVkZjRkNWM4NTA1Nzc0OTllNDE2YTUy">“You as well.”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZWMyMjFiN2U0YzRmY2RiZjJiY2EyMDRkN2UxODA5">“So, silver-ish, but what?” She ran her eyes up and down Vivi. “Caster for sure. Mage or healer?”</p>
<p class="cnMzYzVkNWE2NTA4YTQyOTE5MzlmMmY1MjlkOTY2MTI4">“Mage. But—no, thank you. I’m not looking for a party.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWY0NjNmNDY0YzQxM2M5NjdiODEwNzNhN2NhZDc4">She was somewhat interested in interacting with locals, but not right now. She wanted to make some coin and settle her situation down, not to mention experiment with her magic. This was a complication she didn’t need.</p>
<p class="cnMzODA4YzE1YWEzYjRmM2RiYjFkYjZlNTI0YTk0ZGFh">Lailah deflated. “You sure? We’re not planning anything crazy. An easy trip, something to pass the time till festivities get going.”</p>
<p class="cnM4OGU1Y2NhOTJhYTQ1NDc4YTU0NDFmMTI1NGI2NDVj">If it was that easy to make Vivi reject her anti-social ways, she wouldn’t have ended up in this situation in the first place. “I’m certain.” She wasn’t trying to be rude, so she added, “I have my own plans. Thank you for the offer.”</p>
<p class="cnNmOWFkMTdiMTNhNjQxODg5NzY1YzRlYjZmNTM1ZWU3">“Ah, well. Let me know if you change your mind. See you around?”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGEzMTM0MWZjMzRhZjQ4OTQ2ZDcwMTQ0ZTg3MDkx">Vivi nodded, and that was the end of the quicktime event.</p>
<p class="cnNhNWZjM2FlYWZjZTQxYWQ5N2MxYTZiZjlmNmU1MWFk">She approached the quest board and scanned the various listings, reading the tasks with interest. Each came with a title, description, rank requirement, and rewards of various types: primarily coin and ‘rank points’.</p>
<p class="cnM2MjFmM2ExODUyZjQ1MmZiZWU5M2FhZDBjMzRjZjI1">Was that really how the world’s rank system worked? Would someone like her, a level twenty-one-hundred-plus, be considered a genuine silver-ranker because she didn’t have enough ‘rank points’? Was there no way to jump forward through sheer power?</p>
<p class="cnM2M2EyNmU3YTE1NDRlZDk5YmZlNDE5M2FmMTI2NjE1">It did make sense to some degree. Like Danny had said, it didn’t matter if she killed the rampaging monster if the whole town died in the process. It wasn’t fully irrational—she’d seen worse systems in her previous life. And for all she knew, there <em>were </em>exceptions for jumping through rank. The receptionist just might not have mentioned them.</p>
<p class="cnM1OWRlZGM4ZTg3NzQ2ZjFiM2JmMDA1YzRhNzlmNTJh">Her musings were cut off by a <em>second </em>person walking up.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDEzMWFmNDhlMzQ1ZDE4MmVjNzNmY2U3OTgxNjFm">“Hey,” came a single, somewhat curt word to her side.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDUxNGMwMDgwMTQ3MjBiMjM4Y2MxYzE3NGI0NDg3">This time, Vivi turned to see a red-haired girl, dressed in adventuring gear, clutching a stack of papers to her chest.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTMwODA5OTEyMzRjMTdhNGUxNWM1ZDgwZTAyNmYx">She had cat ears.</p>
<p class="cnM5NzcxMWRjMmJhODQwM2Y5NTMyMjU1ODMzNTI5OWE5">Beastkin were a common race in Seven Cataclysms. They had been her runner-up choice when making her character, losing only because at that point in her life, she had leaned more toward edgy<em>, </em>stylistically speaking, than cute. But it had been a close call.</p>
<p class="cnNiNmM3Y2ViN2NlZTQzZWI5YjI5ZDc0ZDcwNjQ5OTA4">Vivi tried not to stare. A pair of tall red cat ears twitched, as if sensing attention on them. Vivi tore her eyes down to meet the girl’s.</p>
<p class="cnM2NDgyZmFhZmEyMzQyNDViYTZjMGI3MjMxYTk4MjBi">“You were talking with Lailah, right?” she demanded, her tone the exact opposite of the previous woman’s—not hostile, but not making any attempt at friendliness.</p>
<p class="cnNmNTVmMDM0MDA5OTQ5YTRiNjY0OGU5OTk4ZTdiN2E0">“Yes,” Vivi said slowly. “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NmJkMmM3YzRiOTQwYTU5ZjJmOGFiNmNkZWU1YTU1">The other girl frowned. She glanced at the green-haired woman, who had taken her seat at the table near the receptionist’s desk. She looked back at Vivi and studied her.</p>
<p class="cnNjMzhlMWZmNzk2ZjRhMjI5NmQ2YjBjMzQ4YjkyNTk0">“What did you think of her?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYjhiYWM2YzMzMjQyYzY4ODQwODkxNTIyOGU2ODcw">Vivi hesitated. “She was…friendly.”</p>
<p class="cnMzM2Y3NjM4MjMzMzQ4ZjQ4NGM2Zjk2MTIzYTRjODVh">The catgirl nodded viciously. “Too much so, right?” It was an enthusiastic response, as if she had assumed Vivi had made the same deduction as her. But she hadn’t. Vivi didn’t even really understand the implication.</p>
<p class="cnNjNWU5YjYxODRjZTRlNTE5MzIzZjhlNTM3NWU4YjZi">“Perhaps?”</p>
<p class="cnM5NzIzYWMwOTEwNzRiYzM5MjQzN2Q5N2Y3ZmNiYjJj">She eyed Vivi, the enthusiasm fading. A frown tugged her lips downward. “Hm. You didn’t notice. For some reason, I thought…” She clutched the stack of papers against her chest tighter. “She offered you a place on her team, didn’t she?”</p><span class="cmFmZjg0MDZhMjA4OTQxYWQ5NTQ5MTBhMDQyNjVmMmNm"><br>Ensure your favorite authors get the support they deserve. Read this novel on the original website.<br></span>
<p class="cnM2YTVmNTg5YzY1YzRmOGFhYmMyOTk3NjQ2ZDRlYjYx">“She did.”</p>
<p class="cnM0YzY5NTEzMmJlMzQ0NjA5YWZjZjEzYTJiZTc3NmE0">“Don’t accept it. Something’s off about her. That man too. She’s only been giving invitations to people who aren’t established in town. Newcomers for the festival.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNmVjNzA0ZTMzMjQzOTM4NTM0MWJlNWY4ZjI2MTYz">“She didn’t seem suspicious to me.”</p>
<p class="cnNlY2YxOWRlY2Y2ZjQ5MGRhZjNjNDU4ZDc5MmViNWM3">The catgirl gave her the most dubious look yet. “Dangerous people wouldn’t be dangerous if it was easy to tell. Predators hide, that’s what they do. Mask themselves in the environment. Notice how she’s at the closest table to the receptionist’s desk so she can swoop in on anyone she marks as a target? And she’s <em>only</em> going for newcomers. How’s she even know who’s who? I haven’t seen her around.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWVmMDZmOWVhNTQ5M2VhN2MzY2ZhZmM2ZmUwMWUx">Vivi couldn’t answer that second part, but the first had an easy explanation. “She might be assuming newcomers are more likely to accept. People established in town are probably already on a team, or otherwise busy.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMWI5MWE3NzViZDQzYWE5M2FjNDUzNGVlYWUxODU0">The girl grimaced; she knew it was a good point. “Yeah, fair. I shouldn’t make accusations without evidence, I just—she doesn’t seem right. It’s so obvious.” She squinted at Vivi. “How old are you?” she asked, the first person to cast doubt in the <em>opposite </em>direction, as if initially thinking Vivi was older and thus wiser than she appeared, but was now revising her opinion.</p>
<p class="cnMwOTkyNTk5NGVkYjQ2YTJhZjIyYTlkMjNjNjE3ODU3">Was this girl just paranoid? Vivi had thought Lailah seemed friendly. She hadn’t sensed the slightest bit of deceit. It had seemed like a normal interaction, an adventurer offering to party up out of convenience. But now she was doubting herself.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDM4NGI0Y2ZmZTRmYThiYmM3M2NmYWM5MDBiMDVi">“Well, never mind,” the girl said. “Did you say yes or no?”</p>
<p class="cnNmOTQ3NDQxZjBmNTQ2NWE4OTJlMTFlOWMwNWQ2ZGU2">“I declined.”</p>
<p class="cnM4OTg0ODQ3ZGRmNzQyMTI4OWZjZGUyNGFkZmY0NjJi">“Good.” She seemed genuinely relieved. “Uh, anyway,” she said, looking down at the stack of papers she was clutching. She pulled one out and thrust it at her. “Keep an eye out, okay?” It was less of a request and more a demand.</p>
<p class="cnNhODNmODNkNTBmMDQzNjVhM2U3YTAwN2IwZTg0OTAz">Vivi took the poster and looked at it. A simple illustration of a dignified-looking cat with a black fur eye patch was printed—magically printed?—on the paper, along with some text. <em>This </em>was what she’d been carrying around? She looked at the girl in a new light, of course finding it amusing that the cat beastkin was passing out missing cat posters.</p>
<p class="cnM2YmM5ODViYzFkYjQxNTNhYzVjNzA4NzU1MmMwZDFj">She seemed to sense Vivi’s amusement. Her eyes narrowed and her ears flattened slightly. “Got something to say?” she nearly growled.</p>
<p class="cnM1MDBkMTRmMzM3ZjQ4NzhiYzdkM2RiOTM4MzMwZjQ2">Way, way too cute. It took everything Vivi had to keep a straight face. “I’ll tell you if I see him.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MTBhNGI1NmVmYjQxYTY5YTliMmY2NTE1NDRmZGMz">The catgirl nodded. “Good.” She turned away, but paused and looked over her shoulder. “Saffra, by the way. And thank you.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZWUxMmFhODgwNTQxNDJhNTE4Njc5Mjg2NDVjMzVk">“Vivi,” she replied, equal parts amused and bewildered by the interaction.</p>
<p class="cnNlN2JlNTQyZjk3MTRlZDY5Nzk0ZGNjMjkyYThlMzRj">Vivi watched her walk away, mulling over the situation. A seed of doubt had been planted. She truly, genuinely didn’t know whether Saffra’s worry was well-founded. She glanced at Lailah, but she was chatting happily away with her partner. Even appraising her in a new light, she sensed nothing strange.</p>
<p class="cnM1N2ZhYTE5OGIzZjQ5YmY5YmE3NDRkZjA3NzQxMWVj">Hm.</p>
<p class="cnM4NjQ4Y2E1OTUxMjRmYjg5YWJkYzk3ZDNlODUzYjI2">Paranoia was infectious, because despite not having a good reason to do so, Vivi pulled together a spell, muting the visual effects and incantation. She placed a tracking beacon on Lailah and her bulky warrior partner.</p>
<p class="cnMwMDgzMTNhY2M1ZjQyMGNhNDA5OTM0Y2JjMWEyNGU3">Better safe than sorry.</p>
<p class="cnMwMzNlODAzOGRjNDQyYTk5YmY2NWEzOGZmODI2N2M5">That done, she scanned the quest board a little longer, then turned away.</p>
<p class="cnNkMzk2ZDA1MjNkYTQxZTc4M2I5NDc0ZmZjZGQxOWFh">She’d gotten what she needed out of the Adventurer’s Guild. Now she wanted to experiment, and earn some coin while doing so.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTA5OGZkNTM3ZjRkMjg5Zjg2M2EyMTg0NjQ1YjIy">She walked out of the Guild, turned into an alleyway, cast [Invisibility], [Fly], and [Blink], and was suddenly a thousand feet in the air.</p>
<p class="cnMyZWQxYzc4ZjNhZTQ3OGNhMzFlMDZhMzg0M2FjZTE3">The world of Seven Cataclysms might not be one-to-one how she remembered it, but she’d spent tens of thousands of hours grinding. She knew the map better than almost anyone. Orienting herself as she floated high above the city, she faced in the direction of the Hoarfrost Plains. Those should make good hunting grounds.</p>
<p class="cnNkZjdlOTg1YzIyOTRmNTQ4ZGUxMmZkOTBkNzExMzk5">“[Blink].”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDlkOTRmMDBiYTQ3Y2NhOTRlNjkxOGY3YzVmNGJh">“[Blink].”</p>
<p class="cnM1YjZjZmRhNWJmNTQ0NWE4NjgxZmFjOTcwZDFkNmIy">“[Blink].”</p>
<p class="cnM2NGE3NTE5MzA3YTQwMTI4YzBkMWExZGUyMmRiZjJj">The short-range teleportation skill was definitely one of her favorites. The experience of materializing thousands of feet in another direction, the world shifting around her, and at a tiny cost of mana relative to her gigantic pool was amazing. The wonder that came with using magic was going to take a while to wear off.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDI5NGQzYzY3ZTQ3YmFiNjI4N2FkODFmMjM0ZTZl">“[Blink].”</p>
<p class="cnM3MTMyYTcwN2JhMTRhZDViODc3NjZkZGFjYzQwZTJl">“[Blink].”</p>
<p class="cnMyOWFhNWFlZjk4NzQ5ZGM5YmU0MzU2OGUwN2ZiMDJi">“[Blink].”</p>
<p class="cnNiNGI1OTg4MzY1MDQxNjViMzdhNzc2ZjY3OTYzMzc4">She could probably reach Meridian fairly swiftly with this method, relatively speaking, though it would still take hundreds or thousands of the spell. The map was huge, and based on how many [Blinks] it was taking to get to the Hoarfrost Plains, even larger than the digital version.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTE3ZjY1ZjVkYzQyMWFhY2JhMjIwMTQxOTExYjY1">She would probably take the train. She was in no rush.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzFjZWQ0ZjE0MzRiNjU4NzgxNDJhNGQyN2NiYTdi">“[Blink].”</p>
<p class="cnMwOTRhODYyMmViZTQ0Nzg4ODMxZDVmOTkyMThlOGZl">“[Blink].”</p>
<p class="cnNiNzI2ZmVmN2ZjZjRkOTE4ZDE2ZTM1YjAwZjJlYzc5">“[Blink].”</p>
<p class="cnNjYThjYWUwNTZkYTRkNDY4NGUyM2U4ODUyYWY5YjNm">The city of Prismarche disappeared behind her. She passed the jagged teeth of the Granite Spines. The sprawling plains of one of her preferred mid-tier hunting grounds appeared after many dozen [Blinks]: The Hoarfrost Plains. She’d spent more than a hundred hours grinding resources and levels in this zone.</p>
<p class="cnNkMzkzNmUwODAzYjRkNjg5MjdlYzUwODY0NjlmZmQz">“[Detect Presence].”</p>
<p class="cnNjOTJmNTRmOTU4NTQ5MmI5ZTMzNTA3NTY2NTYxNDcw">The temperature had grown bitingly cold, enough that even she felt vaguely uncomfortable in the icy howling wind. Her stats shielded her against most of the effect, but not all.</p>
<p class="cnM4MjA3N2Y4OTE5MzRjYTFhM2NhMzdiNGNhNDRkODM2">“[Aura of the Ember Giant].”</p>
<p class="cnM3YzZjZjI3MjcxMDQzNGI5NWE2NjUxZWNlOTNhMzY2">Much better.</p>
<p class="cnNlNzNjZGUyYzJjMjQyNTZhZWNlMmIwZjFjNjY1ZDRm">Floating down, her bare feet touched the tight-packed snow of the Hoarfrost Plains, toes digging into snow. She pulled her robes in tighter by instinct, even if the hot glow of the spell meant she might as well be standing inside a heated inn. It was bizarre, hair flapping around in the gale of a raging tundra but not feeling the slightest bite of cold.</p>
<p class="cnNiMGVmZTIyNzJlYzQ3Y2JhMDBiN2U3ZGQyOTVjMDAy">She was learning to adapt to ‘bizarre’. This was the hundredth case in the past few hours.</p>
<p class="cnNlNjdjODZkOGUyMDQ4OWFiOTFiMGJlOWNkMDZiMmI0">She had set down near a pack of gigantic Frostmaw Titans, polar bear beasts twice the size of an elephant. In the early days of Seven Cataclysms, hunting them had been one of the best mid-game money-grinding methods, since the armor set made from their pelts was surprisingly poorly balanced. Basically every rogue and even some tank classes wanted it around the seven hundred level.</p>
<p class="cnM1MzMwOGI2ZjQ0MjQ2NTJhNzFkN2VkZWNhNjI0NjM5">Seven hundred was low compared to her two-thousand plus, but she wanted to stay vaguely<em> </em>under the radar, and she doubted the Adventurer’s Guild would be able to compensate her for some of the highest-tier monster parts she could collect. This was a good middle ground. Plus, hunting in the Hoarfrost Plains would be nostalgic.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjkwMDQ0YmNiMjQ1MTdiMjIxMzhhNDYwZTgwYTg1">Crunching her way through the snow, she approached the trundling mountains of fur. She mulled over how to kill them. Smiting a quarter mile of terrain in every direction with that same level 1800 spell [Kaelum’s Thousand-Year Pyre] was obviously a terrible idea, since she wanted to harvest parts to sell, which wouldn’t be possible if she vaporized them.</p>
<p class="cnM0MmRkZWU1MGYzMDQwZTY5NjdkYzNiZmY2NWY3NzJk">Something clean and efficient. The idea made her wrinkle her nose. The whole reason for picking a mage class was the fireworks. Explosive, flashy abilities were the only real way to have fun.</p>
<p class="cnNlYmVlMTRiYzZjZjRmZTBiMzczMDk3N2VhZTY1ZjNk">But she guessed she wasn’t out here to have fun.</p>
<p class="cnMzZTI4N2ExMzgwMjQzNzZhMTYyNzgyMzk0ODMzYzVj">Well, she kind of was.</p>
<p class="cnM1Yjg3MmI2YzVkOTQwNzg4MmIwMzc0M2E1ZDE0ZDFm">“[Skills].”</p>
<p class="cnNhZmVlM2NmMzg4ZjQwY2RhNzU4NzRlZDFkZjFhN2Mx">A screen appeared packed with information. Two columns wide, with a small icon in the corner of each subsection to represent the ability. There were options for filtering and searching. The functionality was extremely similar to the original game’s.</p>
<p class="cnMzOWRlZWI5NGJmNTQ2YTM5M2I3YjhmMzdkNzBmYWI1">She tapped over to the ‘spells’ section, which was considerably longer, and began scrolling through.</p>
<p class="cnMxZGM1MjljYjkyZjRiYThiMjhmOWY4NzBhYjBjZTY4">Vivi had played a lot of Seven Cataclysms, but she hardly had an encyclopedic memory of every skill and spell. She was most familiar with the late-game ones. But she needed less…conspicuous spells on hand.</p>
<p class="cnMzYWY2M2E3ZmQ4YTRmOTNhYWI3ZTdiODhkMDJkNmMy">Humming, she flicked through several pages, adjusting the search functions as she committed a few names to memory. Tapping into a given spell opened a diagram describing how to shape the mana and invoke the magic circle, which somehow Vivi understood. It was still weirding her out, the whole ‘I know magic now’ thing.</p>
<p class="cnM5MzBhOTY4MzM2NTQxNDc5OTIxNWZjYTE3NTNhZmI4">Her lips curled upward as she compiled a list of a few interesting mid-tier spells to play around with. They were around the level 800 to 1000 range. That would be impressive, but not anything shocking, right? The Guild NPCs and even her mansion’s butler had been well over that.</p>
<p class="cnM1NDM1NzdjOTBlMjQ3N2ViMzU2OWE0MWU5MTczNzhm">She wondered if any of them were still alive. It <em>had </em>been a hundred years, but most races were long-lived, and even among the humans, several story characters had been implied to be centuries old. So maybe levels extended lifespans?</p>
<p class="cnM5NTc2ZWU4MTNhNzRiYWM5MDA4NzVhMzQyNjA5NWIz">In any case, she mentally closed out of the skill list and the screen disappeared. Her staff appeared in her right hand with a pop of air.</p>
<p class="cnMyZmQ0MjIxZTQwZjRjMDg4M2EwOGFmNzIwNTlhMzBm">Time to hunt giant monster polar bears.</p>

## Chapter 6: 6 - Hunting Trip


                <p class="cnNjM2RiNGI0NzhhYjRhNjg4NWY5ZWM5NjE3OWI1Mjdm">The giant, slavering maw of a twenty-foot mass of fur and teeth slipped and slid against her [Prismatic Barrier], and Vivi admitted she was hyperventilating slightly. Black claws the length of her forearm scraped against the invisible shield, sending rainbow sparks flying. She smelled rotting flesh, felt the hot air of the beast’s roars on her face. Snow crunched as its enormous paws pushed into the ground, giving it leverage to push against her.</p>
<p class="cnMzMzVhNmQ2YjI1MDRlMDNhODJjODFkMzllOTk5ZDZl">Maybe making video games too realistic would be a bad thing, actually. Because while she was definitely engaged, this was more terrifying than exciting. It was certainly cool, and interesting, and unique…but yeah, she had mixed feelings on this experience.</p>
<p class="cnNlODk4ODkyNzJjYTQ0YzZiOTA3ODcxMjU1NDMzNmQz">“[Earthen Anchor].”</p>
<p class="cnM1YTAwMjEwYWU2NTQ4YzBiNTMxNjAxZjlkYzBjYjI2">Vines burst from the ground, whipping out to grab the rampaging Frostmaw Titan. The hulking beast slammed into the ground with a thud that threw up snow all around them, briefly obscuring her vision, and Vivi took several steps back to create space. The monster struggled against the restraints, but the spell was far too powerful for it to break through.</p>
<p class="cnM1OGEyZTM3YjI5YjQxOWI5NWVlYmZkNmQwNWZmNTc0">She looked around. Two other Frostmaw Titans were secured to the ground in the same way. She had saved them for later.</p>
<p class="cnNjODg2ODY5YjBkYjQ0MjZhYjU2NDU1NzA5MDQ0MzY2">Another had been killed gorily. She winced at the viscera and jerked her head away. She wasn’t squeamish, but neither was she inured to piles of exploded flesh and bone. Blowing a monster up with a super-charged fireball, it turned out, was rather messy. Again, there were downsides to realism. The smells especially.</p>
<p class="cnNmYjI1NzFlNjI1MjQ1MjM5NTA4MmM5MzU4MThiOWQ5">She’d had her fun with a ‘flashy’ spell on the first of the Titans. These other three she wanted to harvest. Hence minimal damage, which, unfortunately, meant no spectacle.</p>
<p class="cnM0YTEzMzQxODdlYzQ1MzE5MjY4MzY1YjJlY2MwOGI0">“[Sanguine Vitaphage],” she incanted, pointing her staff at the nearest monster.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDA3YWRhMTdlZjRlZGI5NDY2M2QzZmI1ODhkMTI0">Its thrashing stopped, and a low, whining noise involuntarily escaped the back of its throat. Red streams of energy siphoned out of the mountain of white fur, soon gushing in billowing clouds to gather and condense into a red ball hovering six feet above the beast. The Titan’s vitality was sucked dry in seconds. She supposed her ridiculous stats were to thank. Even weak spells were strong when cast by her.</p>
<p class="cnNhZmIwMzRmMzQ2NzRhOGI4MmM0YjlhZTI2ODY3NGNj">A fist-sized red ball—too shiny and metallic to resemble blood, though the same color—hovered above the dead beast. She flicked her wrist, and the orb went sailing away to disappear into the snow.</p>
<p class="cnM5MjdjYTFiMmY1NTRiOGNhNDFlMzZhNzVlZWRmOTUx">Pure vitality was a great catalyst for further blood magic, but she had no need for it, and it couldn’t be stored for later. Her goal had been this, anyway: the bear had died without a scratch. Perfect for gathering monster parts.</p>
<p class="cnMwODAwNTZmNmQ3YjQ0Y2Y4ZTVlOTFhOTVlMmNkMjM2">“[Loot].”</p>
<p class="cnM4YTY2YzdkMWYyZDQ3YzA4MDVjNWE3ZTRhNDY5NzVm">To her satisfaction, that<em> </em>functionality was still present. She hadn’t been looking forward to skinning and butchering a monster by hand. Well, by magic. Which would’ve been better, but not by a lot.</p>
<p class="cnNmMDFlZmVlZGMzZTRlOTZiNjBmYWQ4NzEyMTJmZjQ5">A screen appeared with a list of available loot.</p>
<p class="cnMzNjkxNjQwNWU0NzQ3OWE4ZTgyNDFkMWI1ODE2MTI2">***</p>
<p class="cnM0YWU0ZDk4OGUxMjQyZDM5ZTFiNTVmOGE0N2VhNGQy">Deceased [Frostmaw Titan]</p>
<p class="cnNhODk3MGU3MTZjNTQwOGE4YzVjOWIwZjFhNTFmNjk4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="cnNjYjQ2MDE1ZDNmMTQ5MDVhNmUwYzVkYjM2NWU1Yjc1">Loot:</p>
<p class="cnNmZDQwZTNiNmIxZjQ1ZTlhMWIzOWQ5MDM1OGVjYzhh">Frostmaw Fangs (x2)</p>
<p class="cnMwYjBlZjIzZTJlYzRmYzY5MzM2YjJjZDY4NGQ2Y2Yy">Titan Bear Claws (x8)</p>
<p class="cnMyZGIyMjk5ZDRhNTRhNjQ4ODE4NDE4NzJlMWViNDY1">Primal Ice Core</p>
<p class="cnM1MGNjMDRhOTY2MjQzMzFhZWE0NWI2NDZkY2Y1Yzgz">Pristine Frostmaw Titan Pelt {[Skinning]}</p>
<p class="cnM1ZGYzMDRjYjYwMjRmNmM5ZWNlZmIwOGJjZDQ1YTAy">Meat (x38) {[Butchering]}</p>
<p class="cnM3N2YyMWJlYjEzZjQ2ZDY5NTI0YWVlMzkzMzkwMjM5">Arctic Essence Gland {[Alchemical Harvesting]}</p>
<p class="cnMyMDYzNTk4MGEyOTQ2YjBiYmJkMjcyYWVmMzZlYjg0">***</p>
<p class="cnMzZmYzYTAwOTQxNzRjYTk4ZTU2ZjFlZTNiYzFlY2Jm">Each of the items could be inspected in turn. She wasn’t sure whether it was a good haul. She recognized most of the loot as items from Seven Cataclysms, but who knew how valuable they were nowadays?</p>
<p class="cnMyN2Y3MjdkNjFkODRiMTRhNDcyMDZhYjYwZDBkNjI4">Half of the loot was only available for harvest because of her crafting skills. Since she had no-lifed Seven Cataclysms, she had maxed out most basic crafting-type skills, especially the ones relevant to her class and the ones best for making money.</p>
<p class="cnMwMWU5NTliY2MyYzRlMGZiOWQxZDU4YjE4MmI1Yzhm">While the world was shockingly realistic, the videogame-like features were still in full effect: she dragged the loot into her inventory and, just like that, was the owner of a new collection of items deposited into spatial storage.</p>
<p class="cnNmZTZkZTYyZTY4ZTQyYWU4YzE2OTQ1NDQzOTkzZmI4">The unexpected part was how the hulking mass of the Frostmaw Titan was suddenly lying there, de-skinned and missing several body parts.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZmJiZWU3MzA0MDRiNzFhNDNjYjczMTU0NTg3MmQw">Internally, Vivi made a horrified face. Her body didn’t though. There was a mismatch between her mind and the body she was in. One she appreciated. Heroes of legend wouldn’t go around acting squeamish about skinning a monster. Those thoughts could remain in her head alone.</p>
<p class="cnM3M2Q1NjEyMTUyYjRjMGU4MTJmMTgyMTA5YmJlMzkz">She killed and looted the next three beasts, then hastily retreated.</p>
<p class="cnNkYWVkZjZjYjRiNjQyMmY4MWUzOGY1YTlmODljMWJj">The smell was just awful.</p>
<hr>
<p class="cnM0OGRiMjBjZGMzZjQxZDdiZjAwMDQ1ZDI4NDM3NzZh">Hunting was an efficient process when she could teleport around, [Detect Presence], kill monsters in seconds, and return to town with a handful more [Blinks].</p>
<p class="cnNmZTJhNzVlOTU4MjRkOWU5MDYwYjZkMjRiNTNmMDc3">An hour later, she was standing in front of the guild receptionist’s desk. Danny looked up at her with a wince, not faring much better with her hangover. She plastered on another smile.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzc4Njc3NDNhNzRlYjI4Yjk0MDc0NDY3OGZiMzBj">“How can I help?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NGQyODlhZTIyNjQ3ZjU5ODI2MzFmMTZhZDcwZWRm">“You mentioned having resources appraised?”</p>
<p class="cnMwYjEyMjdmNWY2YzRiZjlhN2FkNjhiZGQxMDZhYmJi">“Ready to have that done?” She nodded. “Let me go check with Nazriel.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNGI3ZDFkMjlhMTQ4ZmU5MThhYWZmM2VmYWZiZTMw">She walked around the receptionist desk and disappeared through a door labeled ‘Guild Appraising — Approval Required’. A minute later she returned.</p>
<p class="cnNkMTdjMTYyOWM5NDQyMDU5ZmU5MWExNGJkNmUzZTA3">“He’s free. First door on the left.” She smiled at her, and Vivi nodded her thanks.</p>
<p class="cnNjYTU3MGRhNzQxMzRjNTRhYTllMDk4MjA1MjFlZjhi">Walking through and turning left, she knocked on the available door and was met with a “Come in.” The Guild Appraising Room—or whatever the official term was—featured walls covered with unlabeled cubbies, shelves, and other storage units, all covered or otherwise obscured to hide their contents. In the back left was another door, probably leading into an office.</p>
<p class="cnNjOTQzOWFiOTg3YjRlY2NiM2I5ZDg3MzQ5ZWYxY2Jl">The man standing behind the table in the center of the room wasn’t, technically, a man: he was a demon, but Vivi doubted she’d get used to replacing that word properly. Males were men, females were women. Going around calling people ‘demon males’ or ‘elven females’ would just feel weird.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDU2NzIwYTUwNTQ4MzVhOGJmNDliM2UwMmYzOGJk">His white hair was short and neatly styled, with two oni-style horns—straight and pointing up—jutting from the front of his skull. In demon culture, because Vivi was nerdy enough to have read Seven Cataclysm’s lore, that marked him as being of low birth. Curling horns like hers were the mark of high-blooded demons. Not that every curled-horn demon was of nobility, or vice versa; it was a historical indicator, and thus only trended that way.</p><span class="cmRiOTViYWU4ZWExNzQ0YjE4MmFmNzFmNzkxMWI4OWU0"><br>A case of literary theft: this tale is not rightfully on Amazon; if you see it, report the violation.<br></span>
<p class="cnNjMmM3YWM0ZjNmYTQ5OWFiYzZmNWQwOGQxY2Y0ZjY5">His eyes were, like all demons, red, and his skin was white as snow, paler than any human’s could reasonably be. He adjusted a pair of thin silver-framed spectacles as she walked in, and his posture was ramrod straight.</p>
<p class="cnM2NzU2YjU2YTQ5YTQxM2ZiNWExZmY5YjQwYWRlYmI1">“Good afternoon, miss. My name is Nazriel. I was told you were seeking an appraisal?”</p>
<p class="cnMxOTBlNjlmNzM2ODQ5N2ZhNDk1YWFjNjM2ZGZmZmE5">Vivi nodded, not sure how this process was supposed to go. She was happy to let him take the lead. “Vivi,” she replied.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzJmMTVmMTJmMzQwOWVhMDJiNmE2NjllMWQxNDQw">“A pleasure to make your acquaintance.” After a second in which Vivi didn’t respond, he continued smoothly, “Shall we begin?” He gestured at the empty table, and even if she was in a half-foreign fantasy world, she knew what he was asking.</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2I5NWIyYWViYTRlZGRhZjljOWUzZDkxODE4NzMw">She hesitated before opening her loot screen. She wasn’t sure whether locals had access to game screens. They certainly had classes and levels, but she hadn’t seen anyone interacting with screens…but she hadn’t been around many people and certainly not in circumstances where they would need to use one.</p>
<p class="cnMzN2QzOGE2OWNhZTRkOWZhNzlhODUyNWRjZTZhYWFm">It wasn’t like she could fetch the items some other way. So, mentally shrugging, she opened her loot tab and began extracting loot. Nazriel didn’t seem to find that odd, so she tentatively assumed adventurers had access to an inventory in the same way she did.</p>
<p class="cnMzMDM1ZjcxYzI3ODRmYWQ5MzVhMWRmN2NlZDJiYWJk">She started with the small pieces that seemed more like proper loot: the bear claws and fangs.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDFhYjQzZTMwODQ1ZDRiMjQ2OTE2ZjIxODkzOGEy">The appraiser stopped her with a raised hand before she piled more onto the table. “One item type at a time, if you please.”</p>
<p class="cnMyOWMyMGU1ZmMxNTRmNjM4OTM2MTA0YTc2ODcyMjUy">Her suspicion about inventories was confirmed a second later when a magnifying glass materialized in his hand. He picked up one of the massive obsidian-black claws to inspect it, turning the item this way and that.</p>
<p class="cnMyYmNkNThkYTE2MzRmNGM4MDBlMDY2MTljZDA5YTMw">“Hunting Frostmaw Titans, I take it? The Hoarfrost Plains in particular?”</p>
<p class="cnMyNzg2OTFhNDAwZjQ3YmI4NjlmMmZlMjJlMWQ4ZDI3">It probably wasn’t some impressive piece of knowledge, but it showed he had a level of familiarity with the local monsters. “Yes.”</p>
<p class="cnMxMjFkYTQ2YzI2NzRmZTc4ZTk1NGQzMjBmZWYzN2Y3">“How significant of a haul should I anticipate?” He glanced at the items she’d piled onto the table. “I don’t believe I’ve seen this quantity of Frostmaw Fangs and Titan Bear Claws in one place in…” He paused as he considered. “…ever.”</p>
<p class="cnNiOWU3OTQ1ZThjZTRjMjc4Y2Q1YzUxNWQ2NDQzYjI0">Er. Had she been too enthusiastic with her hunting trip?</p>
<p class="cnNmYzlhMzgyOGVjYzQ4MGQ4YjM4MGE0NWRkODQyYTU4">It had only lasted an hour, but [Blink] and [Detect Presence], as mentioned, made for a devastating combo when she could one-shot and harvest whatever she ran into. She’d scoured a non-negligible portion of the Hoarfrost Plains, seeing how life was sparse there.</p>
<p class="cnMxM2JkY2ZkNjI4MTQ1OGZiNTg1MmRlNzQ1N2VmYmZl">“That’s all of them,” she said cautiously.</p>
<p class="cnMxOGU3MjgxYmExODQ3YmM5OTQ2MWI1YmNmMDExOTNl">“But you have similar quantities of other Frostmaw Titan loot, and presumably other locals of the Hoarfrost Plains?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NGZjOTJmYWI2YzRlOGRiM2FmZWI2NGRkNGM2MmMw">She nodded.</p>
<p class="cnNhYTlhMDM5M2Y5NjQyOTlhZWM4OTQ1ZGU0OTQxMTkx">“Would that be the totality of your appraisal today? Or do you have additional items?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZDhjYzZmZWEwZTQ5MDRiYTE2YWM1ODdkNDFkMzQy">“Just from that hunting trip.”</p>
<p class="cnMyYThhYzZkMjAwNzQ4OTQ4NDVjNDIzZmFkMjU0ODE2">“I see.” He nodded to himself and laid the claw back onto the table. “Miss,” he said carefully, “while our branch does deal with orichalcum-ranked adventurers on occasion, a purchase of this size would require approval from the Guildmaster, and I feel obligated to inform you that you might be better suited dealing with an external merchant consortium or trading house. In-guild exchanges are usually for…newer adventurers. Or, rather, mithril ranks and lower. Orichalcum grade products are valuable enough they’re handled with more care—the overhead required in finding proper buyers pales in comparison to the prices the items themselves fetch.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNmMxZWM2Mjc0ZDQ3MjI4Y2M0ZmZlNWFkZmZhNDY2">Okay, she could tell he was bewildered, but only because of the content of what he’d said. He sounded perfectly composed and had laid out the explanation without faltering. He just wasn’t the sort of person to start gawking at her.</p>
<p class="cnNmZTM1Yzg1ZjA3NzRjNDhhYWRkYWNlYTg5MmI3ZDY2">Straight-faced, Vivi replied, “I don’t care about getting the best deal. Will you buy it?”</p>
<p class="cnNiMzRiOTdmYjczMDQwY2I4ZTZiY2YyM2Y0YTQ5MmI2">“I cannot imagine the Guildmaster would refuse. We have standard pricing for common loot found on orichalcum-rank monsters, and even local Titled-rank. These would make easy, significant profit for the Guild. We simply don’t see such products pass through often, likely for that exact reason.”</p>
<p class="cnNlN2U5Y2FmZWFhNTQyYjdhZDFiZTcyZTQ3NWYxNDk0">“Then please continue.”</p>
<p class="cnNlYzcwYjZiMjZjMzQ4ZDZhOTdkMGU4ZGJkOGFmYjRj">He nodded and did so without further comment.</p>
<p class="cnNiZjgzNWM1MjcxMjQzNTQ5NGRhNGFhZmJlODE0ODIw">Part by part, he inspected each of the items and suggested a price, occasionally referencing a notebook and tallying the total in another. One-third of the way through, Vivi told him to choose whatever price he thought was fair, and that she didn’t want to haggle. She didn’t care; she needed some ‘starter money’ seeing how she was locked out of her bank account.</p>
<p class="cnMyZDAzMTU5NTU3MjQ2NDlhNmQyZmJjNDliOTVhZDE0">She was pretty sure she was going to turn more of a profit than she’d intended. Enough to draw attention from the Guildmaster. She was seriously failing at her goal of laying low.</p>
<p class="cnMyOTliYjYzZmU3MDRlODRhMTQyZGIzM2RhYzhkODgw">The appraiser deposited some items into his inventory, and for others, wrapped them in various materials and placed them in drawers or cabinets. She wasn’t sure what his exact logic was, but she guessed it had to do with spoilage. The claws and teeth, for example, were stored physically rather than in his spatial storage.</p>
<p class="cnM0MDFkYjY3Y2NlNjQ3ODlhNmJmNWZhMjYzMzFiOWZi">“This meat is extraordinarily well preserved, and portioned,” he commented, inspecting one such slab laid out on paper. “Skill extracted? A high-level one. Feel no obligation to respond, of course, I’m merely speaking to myself.”</p>
<p class="cnMxYjU5YzRmZDUzZTQzZGFiZTQzOTFlZWQ3ZTJjNzJj">When everything had finished, Nazriel consulted his notebook. He went through and added the sums together, paused, squinted, and shook his head in incredulity. It was the most reaction he’d given for what Vivi knew had to have been a highly unusual experience.</p>
<p class="cnNiYWQyOGViYmI4ODQzMWI4NzRlYTU0ODU5YzgyZTAz">“The Festival always brings interesting characters,” he said mildly. “I’ll go speak with the Guildmaster. It won’t be more than ten minutes. He’ll find you in the lobby?”</p>
<p class="cnMyNjI2YTRlMDliZjQ0Mjc4YTM3MDU5ZTVlZGIzNTEw">She nodded, and he showed her the way out.</p>
<p class="cnM2MmIyNWU4MGE1ZDRiNTg5ZWVjZTNiMDdjMWRhM2Ex">Back in the lobby, she scanned the tables for familiar faces: Lailah or Saffra. Neither was present.</p>
<p class="cnNmNzAzMTJhYjE5ZDQ2NGNiYzZkNzhjMjA3ZmExNDJl">Closing her eyes, she mentally quested out for the magical beacon she’d placed on the green-haired woman. She was somewhere on the edge of the city, close enough to the gates Vivi suspected she was leaving for that hunting trip she’d mentioned.</p>
<p class="cnNmOWNlZGY4ZjE1NDQ1ZmNhODAyZTVjNjAxMWUxZmJi">Saffra’s warnings had taken root in her head. She was probably being paranoid, but after she was done dealing with this loot debacle, she intended to ensure nothing strange was going on with Lailah. It wasn’t like Vivi was pressed for time. She didn’t have any real goals, much less pressing ones, besides returning to Meridian and finding out what had happened to her house, guild, and relevant NPCs.</p>
<p class="cnM1MThkNzVhNWJhYTRmMmM5ODI3OTM3M2NlYmEzNzU1">The Guildmaster tracked her down a few minutes later, with Vivi standing at the quest board, arms crossed and frowning down at the floor. She looked up at the heavy footsteps approaching her.</p>
<p class="cnMzOWJlZDFmZTc0NTQwNmFhZGVhNWQ4ZDdjYjFlNTM1">He was a middle-aged human man, dark hair balding on top, a bit of a beer gut, with muscled, hairy forearms. He reminded her of a retired blue-collar father, which frankly might be a solid equivalent for this world. Vivi assumed most Guildmasters would be experienced adventurers settling down.</p>
<p class="cnMwYWYyYzczNjI4ODQ1ODhiOTI2M2NkZjZhMDFmZjhk">His face was a lot easier to read than the demon appraiser’s: caution bordering on suspicion on his features. It wasn’t blatant, though. It was hidden past an ostensibly neutral expression, and he nodded at her when their eyes met, sticking out a hand to shake. She took it.</p>
<p class="cnMyNmRiZWQwMTg3MDRkMWZhMDBiZjNmYzgzZTA5Yjll">His squeeze started firm and rapidly increased in strength—something she was weirdly <em>aware </em>of, while barely feeling the pressure.</p>
<p class="cnM1MThkYmQxMTJhYjRlYTU5ZTk1MGU3M2Y0ZTY1ZDIy">It hadn’t been a dominance display, or an attempt at one. His face had grown grim, and she could tell he’d confirmed something to himself.</p>
<p class="cnNjYTQ5YWM5NDQ2NDQ4YzZhYzljY2QyYmY1ZGZiOGU4">Because, yeah. Vivi might be a mage, but she was level 2100, and all stats scaled with level. She was actually absurdly strong by regular standards, and the Guildmaster had confirmed that. Sneaky. She couldn’t find it in herself to disapprove of his methods. He was just scoping out a potential threat.</p>
<p class="cnMwMDc3MzVmODNlOTQ2YzRhYzI3YWYxOTI2OTNlMmM3">“Good to meet you, miss. Dougal Flint. Just thought I’d come and see you myself, considering the—situation. New in town?”</p>
<p class="cnMzZmFhYTQ0ZjlhYTQ2NjBiYWZhNTgxYzdjNDFmNGM1">“I’ve been before.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NDhiZmRkMmNlYTQwMzI4NmFhY2U0YTBhN2U5NDA4">“Have ya?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZjU5ODNmNTNjMjRlZDhiMTE4ZmU0NzAzMDdiY2Jm">“…A hundred years ago, or so.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMjgwN2E5MDg2NjRkYzY4MTQ5YTg0NGExOTE0MTVj">She probably shouldn’t have said that, but she was bad at small talk, and it’d been all she could think of.</p>
<p class="cnNjNmMxM2NiNGVjNjQ0Nzc5ZDc3OGFlNmE4MDVmMGNi">His eyebrows went up, but he didn’t seem surprised. Thankfully, elves and demons were common in the city, and they were long-lived races. Plus, being introduced by Nazriel as ‘the weird orichalcum or higher rank adventurer’ had probably dispelled any ideas about her age, regardless of her appearance. Not everyone was quick to assume short and petite meant child, anyway. It just happened more often than Vivi preferred.</p>
<p class="cnNlMWRlMzVlYmUyODQ0ZWM4NzA5YTJjN2I3YTMxOTBj">“I see. Changed a lot in that time, I expect?”</p>
<p class="cnNhMjBjOGZiZDVmYjQ3YTJiNDBhZjk0ZjFkMDlkZGVm">She didn’t mean to be rude, but she wanted to check on Lailah, and she didn’t do well with casual conversations. Not with people she didn’t know well, at least. “Will you be approving the purchase?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNGJmMGY0M2M4MTQ2MTQ5MTFhMzI4M2U5YjZkYjYx">He frowned slightly, but didn’t take offense at the abruptness. “Long as there won’t be bad feelings. Never good business, getting on the bad side of high rankers. You’d be better off selling elsewhere, but I’m sure ya know that already. Not lecturin’ you or anything.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZWNkZGNhMWYyYTRhNTFiMjFkN2Q4ODBhZjhiYTk2">“It doesn’t matter.” They were treating this like it was a big deal, but it had been an hour-long prance-around in the Hoarfrost Plains, which she could reach in minutes. “I have places to be. Can we finalize?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MThkZGUyNTBlMTQ5OTU4ZTEyNGRmNWU3ZWMzMjY1">Again, he didn’t seem to mind her curtness. He was just studying her curiously. “Won’t hold ya if you’re busy.” He pulled out a pouch stuffed with coins—he’d prepared it before coming. “Thirty-six mithril and change. Fairest price we could muster. Hope to see you around, miss.”</p>
<p class="cnNhYjc4MmE1NjFhYjQzYTk5ZDJkZmUzNGQ5ZTAyYWE5">Even if he did sound like he appreciated the tidy profit his Guild had no doubt made, he didn’t sound like he actually wanted to see her around again. Vivi could imagine why. She expected that for guildmasters, high-rankers appearing out of nowhere were usually walking headaches.</p>
<p class="cnM4MWIxN2M5NDUxYjQ1MzBiYzUyNTg4Nzk3MWY5MGQw">She tucked the bag of coins into her inventory. They automatically sorted into the currency bar at the bottom, with the pouch itself being labeled as ‘empty pouch’. Convenient.</p>
<p class="cnM4MmNlNjZhZGRkZDRkNWM4ZDliNjJlY2EzMjMyM2Nk">With that, it was time to see whether anything was happening with Lailah. Sooner rather than later. For some reason, she couldn’t shake the feeling of unease.</p>

## Chapter 7: 7 - Scouting


                <p class="cnMxMjNmZTBhY2Q0MTRkOTI5OTU4MjdlYWU4YjJjNGM1">Vivi flew across the city, marveling at the wonder of the experience. Beneath her, Prismarche sprawled out. The city had grown, but compared to modern cities as she knew them, it was tiny. It had to be, when the entire city was enclosed in a wall. Cities in safer territories could get away without defensive barriers, but not this far north.</p>
<p class="cnNiNTY1Mzg5YzQwNTRjZjg4NDU4YjM3ZDY5ZWVlMGVj">Lailah had worked her way into the wilderness. As Vivi caught up, she saw that the woman’s party consisted of four people. Lailah, her teammate ‘Dom’, a young man in white robes, and the surprise addition: Saffra. The red-haired catgirl seemed to be a mage, based on the slim length of white wood she was carrying—a wand.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTc5NzZlMDlmYTQ5ZDhhYmMyYzA0MGRhOTNiYTVl">After the warnings Saffra had given, Vivi was baffled as to why she would accept a party invitation from Lailah. Briefly, she wondered whether she had warned her away as some sort of ploy to ensure her own spot on the team.</p>
<p class="cnM1YWI2NzkzZjExNDQ3MDE4OTYzOTk2YmQ0YTMwYzZj">But that didn’t make sense. Saffra was glaring daggers at the two older adventurers, only wiping the expression away when they looked her way.</p>
<p class="cnNkNDIxYmZjZDBkOTQ4NzQ5N2Q3NzU2ZDkwNmM5NDg3">The party of four was trekking through the pine forest that started immediately outside Prismarche’s walls. If logic between game and reality held, Prismarche was in the far north of the human continent, in a dangerous area even by the standards of this monster-infested world.</p>
<p class="cnMzODhmNzk3YjIxOTQwZmY4YmQzNmZlMmVhOTQ3ZGVi">Vivi hadn’t needed to travel far to reach orichalcum-rank monsters—which seemed to be shorthand for levels 800 to 1000—and such beasts could rampage through the vast majority of adventurers. She didn’t think any amount of gold-ranks could kill one, and gold ranks were already uncommon from what she’d seen at the Adventurer’s Guild. Most were bronze and silver.</p>
<p class="cnM1MWY2OTY2ZDJiYjRlNDI4ZmFhY2U5NmNmZjJlYjgx">Exiting the safety of Prismarche immediately brought people into level 200 plus territory. Meaning silver-rank threats. It wouldn't take long for this party of four to find monsters worth their time, seeing how all of them were wearing silver badges themselves.</p>
<p class="cnNlODdjZTk2Y2MxYTQ4ZTBiNjBmM2Q3Zjk4NmNhZmVj">Vivi was almost certain she had let unfounded paranoia guide her decisions, but Saffra’s worry had been so genuine, and remained so palpable even now, that Vivi persisted, hovering above the group with [Invisibility] active.</p>
<p class="cnNjZjI5YmZjOGRhZjQ2Y2U5YzY2Y2VmNzBjY2VhOTdi">Better safe than sorry.</p>
<p class="cnNjNTI1OTg5YmJhODQ1MzVhMTFmMmY2MGRiNjc5ZGM3">***</p>
<p class="cnNmMTJkYzAzZGI3YTQxNTliZDQwMmQ4ZjcyZjJhNzhl">These creeps weren’t fooling anyone.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZGM0NzBjMmFmNzRiNGU4Y2RiMmIzMjA5MmE0ODBm">Trekking behind Lailah and Dominic, Saffra glared at their backs as Allen went on and on about some healing spell he’d recently mastered. This boy had to be several years older than her, but it sure didn’t feel like it. Did he not realize the situation he was in? The danger these two represented?</p>
<p class="cnNkMjM4ZTllOTA2YTQwNDRhYmVmMmNlOWVhOGI2NmZh">Not that she could be certain of anything. Lailah and Dominic’s reasons for arriving in town were perfectly natural. Prismarche, being the nearest border city to the seventh Cataclysm Monarch’s domain and thus the Party of Heroes’ final destination, had always thrown extravagant festivals on Peace Day. On the centennial celebration, travelers had come from all across the continent.</p>
<p class="cnM2ODM0YTY0NGQxMjQ4ZGNhNzY0ZDRjMmQ3NzA3YzJk">Prismarche already fielded more adventurers than average, but with the festival, there were three times the normal amount in the city. Maybe even extra orichalcums, possibly a Titled. An influx of new faces wasn’t odd. Not in the slightest.</p>
<p class="cnM0MzkwYTU3OTcwNjQxMjZhMWQzYmQ4NmEwYzAxYjEz">Lailah and Dominic’s stories checked out in all aspects.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDVlMzUyOWQyODRmMzE5MjE2MGFiNzk5MmM3ZTZh">She didn’t care. Something was off about them. Saffra trusted her gut. After what had happened the last time she hadn’t, she wouldn’t ignore her instincts again.</p>
<p class="cnM5NzI3NDJlN2I5ZjQ3ZDliOWE1NTExYzhhNDJiNjdm">She clutched the silver necklace hanging around her neck to calm her nerves.</p>
<p class="cnM0M2JiMWQyYjc1NjQ1M2M5YWU3YTFmNmRmOWM2YjQ3">The question was, why was she out here with them?</p>
<p class="cnM4ODc3OTlmODZjMTRlYzQ5NzUxMzk5YmEwMzVjMTI5">She should be looking out for herself. Who cared if this blond-haired clueless idiot had blindly accepted their party invitation without a worry in the world?</p>
<p class="cnNjZWY2ZTJmYmZiMzQ3ZGJiMjA2ZGJkNjQwZTdhZjkx">She didn’t even know Allen. Apparently he was a local, an acolyte at the temple, and often visited the Guild. So maybe she should. She’d been in Prismarche for four months and had made the Guild her home; she slept there every night. She guessed his face was vaguely familiar.</p>
<p class="cnMxYTc1ZmI3YzdkOTQ2OGZhYzM3Yzk1MDA0NDNlNjA5">But no, she hadn’t accepted Lailah’s invitation because she knew Allen. She just…couldn’t let this cheerful idiot face this alone.</p>
<p class="cnM1YjRlYjIzZWJlZjQ1ZTY4ZGE0MzdlMTVhZjMyMGNl">And even she knew she was probably being paranoid. Something about Lailah and Dominic made her skin itch, but what was she expecting? That they would murder them to harvest their belongings without fear of retribution from the city guard? Adventurers did tend to carry around most of their net worth on their person, so it wasn’t implausible. Murdering adventurers was a great method for making money, if one didn’t have morals.</p>
<p class="cnMxM2IwMGE5Y2M1YzRhODc5MWY1MDI5MzNkNzlmOTJm">Or worse, capture and sell them alive?</p>
<p class="cnNjODU1NjA5YjI2ZjQ3MzJiZmRlMzIwNzQwM2Y1ZjI4">In either case, that was where Saffra’s mind had gone, generally speaking. It wasn’t all that rare. Not <em>common</em>, but there was a dark underbelly of crime throughout the human kingdoms—any civilization really—that even the most naive of citizens were wary of.</p>
<p class="cnM3OGQzMmE3MmZjNjQ2ODRhMTFiNThjNjI0ZmQ5ZDdl">And adventurers were some of the easiest people to make disappear without suspicion. What would most people think, even Guild staff, if an adventuring mission ‘went awry’ and a team came back minus a person or two? They might make token efforts toward an investigation, but even with divination magic—should they find justification for employing someone who could cast it—they wouldn’t find anything. Not with so little to go on.</p>
<p class="cnMxMjQ1N2Q2MDYwYTRiZDNhNmVmMzNkNmZlYTI4YzI5">Logically speaking, ninety-nine out of a hundred times two older adventurers offering a quick team-up would be friendly camaraderie. Something to do before celebrations began in earnest that night. In fact, that the invitation had been framed as an easy mission further suggested nothing strange was going on. It would be more suspicious, now, if something went wrong.</p>
<p class="cnM3MDAyOWI0ZTIzZTRlYmE4YmE2M2QwOWRiNjFmMDQw">Yet Saffra had such rotten luck that ninety-nine in a hundred odds didn’t comfort her in the slightest.</p>
<p class="cnMxMTdjZDg2OTMzOTQzY2Q5MmZiYzU4YTk1YzgyNDNj">In any case, she should be looking out for herself. But she hadn’t been able to convince this tall blond boy to decline the invitation, so Saffra had walked up and offered to join too, and after a moment’s consideration, Lailah had smiled and accepted.</p>
<p class="cnM3MTRmZmY4YjRjMTRkNzM4OThhODJkMTdjOGIzNDkw">Saffra had to do this. She wasn’t going to let something horrible happen if she could help it. Even if Allen was a stranger.</p>
<p class="cnMzNTIxYzMzY2I5YzRiOGZhNzNjNDNjNTEzNGYzODY0"><em>I can only blame myself,</em> she thought sourly. <em>I deserve what’s coming.</em></p>
<p class="cnM2ZWU2NjhhZTc1MjQwZjFiZTFmZDg4NTM2N2QzZmVl">“Remember what we talked about,” Lailah said, smiling over her shoulder. Saffra remembered to wipe her dour expression clean and nod earnestly. “You two are silver ranks, same as me, so I don’t need to harp on you. But you never know when things’ll go wrong, and someone getting hurt is more likely in an unfamiliar group. Keep sharp.”</p>
<p class="cnM1NTE0YzkzNGRlZDQ2MzVhODQyMmFmN2Y3NjUyOGFl">Allen turned a look toward Saffra as if to say <em>‘See? They’re good people, they’re looking out for us.’ </em>Saffra seethed in silence, her face not betraying her emotions. Her time at the Institute had made her good at that. Though, in her annoyance, she wasn’t able to put up the usual mask, so she settled for an aggressively blank face. Allen faltered, cleared his throat, and kept walking.</p>
<p class="cnMzMDgzYWIwZDIzNzQ3YTM4OTRiNTlkYjE1OWViYTFi">This time of year, the Frostfern Glade was more green than white, and the worst monsters were in hibernation. But it was still more dangerous than almost anything found in southern, safer lands. One of the reasons she’d come here—it made great training grounds. The other, bigger reason was that she’d needed to get as far from Meridian, and thus the Institute, as possible.</p><span class="cjIwYWEyZWE5OWNmNTQwYWY4ZGRiZjVlMTFiYjNmZDQ1"><br>Support creative writers by reading their stories on Royal Road, not stolen versions.<br></span>
<p class="cnNjMTlmY2QyNWZkYjRlNzk5ZTg3OGZiYTBhMzFlZTlh">She kept her attention sharp. It would be awfully awkward if she misguidedly came on a hunting expedition she didn’t want to be on, only to die to <em>actual</em> monsters instead of the metaphorical ones in front of her.</p>
<p class="cnM2NmUwZjZmNDc5ZTQyMmRhYzgxZDM0YzkxN2M5ZmY3">Even if, again, she had zero evidence these two couldn’t be trusted.</p>
<p class="cnM0MmM0MDAxYTQ2ZjRiMzI4ZTM4YWMwYzVmNTdkYWQw">The first few fights went without a problem. Saffra reluctantly admitted Lailah and Dominic knew what they were doing. Almost too much so. They seemed better than silver-rankers ought to be.</p>
<p class="cnNjMjUwZWFlYzRiODQ0NDBiMmRiNTQ5ZmZlMGU4NTUx">Was it another level of paranoid, to add that to her tiny stack of ‘evidence’? That they might be faking rank to more easily lure in prey? If they <em>were </em>killers or similar, they wouldn’t want to fight on equal footing. They would be solidly gold rank at least.</p>
<p class="cnMyMGEyOTFhMDMzZjQ0NzA5ZGM5YmNmNjI0MGJkNWRl">Saffra started to doubt herself as the hunting trip continued. An hour passed, and a second, and it had only intended to be a casual expedition anyway. Peace Day celebrations would begin in the evening. It was already diligent to be making a short trip into the Glade on an impending holiday.</p>
<p class="cnM0M2JiNTZiNTRhNTQzZTc5M2M5YzRkNGFhMWI5MWJi">Sure enough, one fight later, Lailah announced, “That ought to do it. We should head back now. Wouldn’t want to miss any of the fun. Any objections?” She looked around, but received none. “You two did great, by the way,” she added, smiling at Allen and Saffra. “You especially, brat,” she teased Saffra. “I’d swear you’re Institute trained, if not for how the semester ought to still be in session.”</p>
<p class="cnM5YmYzNWU2ZjQzNjRlN2ZiODA2OTA5ZWY5ZTRmYmZk">Saffra hadn’t expected the Institute to be brought up. She stiffened slightly, her mask faltering before she smoothed out her expression again. “I’m glad you think I did okay,” she said, somewhat tensely.</p>
<p class="cnMxNjU3Y2Q4NTdlNTQ0NjdhN2ZiYmRmNzM1MWVkODY4">“More than ‘okay’,” Lailah laughed. “Watching you makes me feel like I didn’t take my career seriously enough when I was young. I’m twice your age, yet we’re wearing the same badge.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZWE3NmU5ZmQ1ZTRhMjNiYTIyOTkwMzc5NzcwZTFj">“Not all paths start and end the same,” Allen said with that sort of faux-wise tone that so many temple acolytes used.</p>
<p class="cnM2NGVhMzA4YWQwYTRhYzlhOWJjM2VmZjY1NmQ4NmI0">Maybe she was being uncharitable. She didn’t dislike Allen, he was just a huge idiot who didn’t know what was good for him.</p>
<p class="cnMxOGQ1ODMyZTlhMzQ3MzNhOWNjNmUwOWRhZTJkMzJl">…Though she was starting to think he’d been right. If something strange was going to happen, it would have by now.</p>
<p class="cnNkZjI4YmM2OThkNzQwMGFiMDAwZjA4MTIzYzhjNjE1">By all accounts, Lailah seemed to be the friendly older adventurer she was pretending to be. Her bulkier partner was both less suspicious and more—because he’d stayed close to silent the whole time, only making call-outs during combat. His broad-shouldered, scarred appearance was suspect…but not really. Scars and a serious demeanor weren’t anything to make someone blink twice in an adventuring career. She was grasping at straws.</p>
<p class="cnMwODQwMjQ2NzFjZTRhZDE4ZGU1ODBlNzI3MWZiM2I3">She really had gotten this one wrong. While listening to gut instincts was important, that didn’t mean every impression would be correct.</p>
<p class="cnNmYzJmNGI0NmNlMTRkMjlhODUzOGYwM2ZjMDJmYWY1">That feeling solidified as they headed back to the city. If something nefarious was going on, it would have happened in the deepest part of the Glade, where a chance-based intervention was least likely. They were already getting close to the city walls, where another adventuring group might be nearby.</p>
<p class="cnMzNDg4ODAwMzJiNzRiMzJhNmIzNmM2NTdhMGUxYmI1">Saffra felt silly about the whole event. At least she’d made some coin and gained experience working on a team. The day hadn’t been a waste, even if she’d had other things she had wanted to pay more attention to.</p>
<p class="cnNkMzRkODJhMDU1ZTRiODdiZDc5NDNhMDc4MGZhZjFi">A folded-up missing pet paper in her left pocket burned in reminder. She’d promised Daisy; she needed to get back to handing out posters.</p>
<p class="cnM0YzRiZGMyYzliMDQ2MDRiMGExZDA2ZGYzM2I1YTZh">In retrospect, it had been planned. These two were professionals. They had waited until her guard was most likely to be down.</p>
<p class="cnNiMDJhZGNlMTY4MTQ1MmNhMmY1YzNmMWE1ZWYxNjkw">Dominic came to an abrupt stop, holding up a fist in the universal sign of danger. Saffra was instantly alert, wand raised and a [Flame Bolt] design sketching in her head.</p>
<p class="cnMyOWJmNWE0YTg1YzQ3MWVhODI1YzFhMjlmMDY0ZWQ2">But it didn’t seem to be an immediate threat. He dropped the gesture and pointed. Lailah stepped up alongside him, peering at what he was pointing at.</p>
<p class="cnMwYjUwZTk5NzI5NzQxZmU5MmY4MTdhZDBiMGI2ZGVi">“Constrictor Creeper,” she announced. “Shit, good eye, Dom.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNGExMmIyNzE4MDQyNjhiNTQ4Mjk5OTc1ODM2OGIz">Saffra and Allen edged up to put eyes on the green vine lying in wait. Fauna infused with stray magic was the most common threat while out hunting, but flora was dangerous too. Plant-type monsters, while less common, were equally as deadly.</p>
<p class="cnNhZDJmMjllZTk4MjQ4YThiMThiODdmZTRkY2RjODlm">Dominic had once again proved himself the quiet but competent sort. Constrictor Creepers were hard to spot. Saffra didn’t know if she herself would have noticed it. And while a group of silver rankers probably wouldn’t have been taken out by one, it could have done damage—maybe killed one of them in the worst case.</p>
<p class="cnNhZDFhYjY2NjQ0NzQ3NzNiN2E5NTYxOThmYzczYmIw">“Where there’s one, there’s usually others,” Lailah said. “I’ll take a look around. Take care of that one.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MDkxMDAwMjI3NTQ2Yjc5Zjg1MTUzNTBhODVkMDNj">Constrictor Creepers could sprawl for hundreds of feet. Saffra glanced nervously around the forest floor, but saw no other discolored vines like what was curled in front of them.</p>
<p class="cnM1MjBhODUyYzJkYTRiMDc4ODdjMTA2NTczYzM5ZDRi">Creepers did tend to clump together, spawned in batches from the same expulsions of natural magic, and clearing them out was common courtesy because finding them was the hardest part, not killing them.</p>
<p class="cnNkYmRjY2U4YmUxODQ2MWY4NmM3MTMxMDBkNjk2Yjc2">Maybe the standard procedure was why Saffra dropped her guard. She’d been keeping an eye on Dominic and Lailah through the expedition, but she didn’t think twice as the rogue stalked away to find other Creepers, gaze locked to the ground like all of theirs were now. Especially because Dominic had grunted, “Weak to fire. Take it out?” And as the team’s mage, it was logical this task fell on her.</p>
<p class="cnMzMDgzZWMzMTY0ODQ1Zjg4ZGI0OTFjNTMyODYxMDJk">The Creeper clump was a few dozen feet away, pulsating against a withered-looking tree. Saffra raised her wand and started pulling together a spell.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzIwODU3ZmNiZjRhYzBiNGZkYTM2NDZjYjM1Mjll"><em>Click</em>.</p>
<p class="cnMwYmU2NWI0Y2U5MDRkNDdhOTY4MmI0ODdhNmExYjNk">She felt something cold and heavy clamp around her neck.</p>
<p class="cnNhZjE4ZmJiZTMzYzQ1NjNhYjQxN2M1ZTZmMWU2OGUz">Her stomach dropped about a mile beneath the earth.</p>
<p class="cnMwYWQ4MzdmOGEwMTQwNDBiNDQwZDU4NGMyZmI4MDdj">“I was starting to think we’d have to be brutes about it,” Lailah commented. “Took long enough for an opportunity to show up. Watching me like a hawk, weren’t you?”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDllMWVlNTA5NTRiZGRhN2M5M2EzMWY3ZmFkMWJl">“Miss Lailah?” Allen’s confused voice came somewhere to Saffra’s side, but she barely heard it. It felt like the moment that cold metal had wrapped around her neck, she’d stopped existing in her own body.</p>
<p class="cnNhNGU0NjYxMzE0ZTRjY2NhOGU4Yjg3ODM3NmIwOTFj">She reflexively drew on her mana even if she knew what would happen. The vibrating energy disappeared into the rune-engraved metal, drunk down greedily.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzNkZDgxY2VlZDRkOTViYzg2ZmZhZGE5OWZjNzZm">Saffra closed her eyes and tried to wake up. It had to be a nightmare. But Lailah continued speaking at her side.</p>
<p class="cnM2MWIzNWMzMzc1NzQwNDVhOGI2ZTgzODhhNWEzMmU4">“I’ll deal with him. Take care of the girl.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNzIzNTY2MmRmMzRiZDY4NjAxZDA4YWM3M2ZkMTA4">And then Saffra was being manhandled, Dominic pulling her arms back and securing manacles around her wrists. That jolted her out of the brief disassociation—she began fighting. He held her easily, forcing her arms back and clicking the restraints into place.</p>
<p class="cnM0NTE0ZjdkOTBjMzRkMmI4N2RhYzdkMTUxODRiN2Uy">“You’re only hurting yourself,” he said gruffly. “Stop that.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNTNkODY0YjExMzRhMTM4MWM4OWU0NTljYzMxZjRl">How had she been so stupid? She’d known. She’d <em>known.</em></p>
<p class="cnM5N2YwN2UzZWZlMDRlOGFiOGJlMGFmN2YyOTRhY2Jk">In short order, she’d been forced to the ground, wrists bound behind her back, magic cut off by whatever suppression artifact Lailah had secured around her neck. Dominic was strangely gentle about the process, and that was almost more terrifying.</p>
<p class="cnMwYjhhZjU2Y2M2MzQ0OTliMzcxNWVmODEwODU5ODA4">Allen was tossed to her side, likewise bound and gagged. He seemed to be in shock, looking around frantically. His eyes met hers. She looked away, squeezing her own shut.</p>
<p class="cnNmY2E1OWU1Zjc3ZjQyNGZhMTI5NTQ2ZWUyNjNlNTU5">This was her fault.</p>
<p class="cnNlMzM0M2M3YmFiNzQ0ZGNhYmE3OGU0MWIzNTFmNjAy">They were capturing them alive. That was the horrifying part. Death was just death. Having their throats slit and being robbed of their belongings wasn’t so bad—it was the preferable of the two outcomes.</p>
<p class="cnNhMzIxOWEzZWU3NTQ1YzlhZDI4OTYyNjQ4ZmJiMjIw">She was hyperventilating. Something like this had happened once before. A miracle had saved her. Nobody was given <em>two </em>miracles.</p>
<p class="cnM2Nzk4ODQ1ZmMwZTQ4YzliMmIzMTY2ODFiOGU1NTk0">Lailah crouched down to her side.</p>
<p class="cnM5MTNmNjVhZDkyNzQ5M2I4NTExOWFjY2Q1MDBkMDA2">“Suspicious little bitch, aren’t you?” she mused with exactly the same cheerfulness as every interaction before. It sounded genuinely friendly. “You were glaring at me before we even met. Why?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNzFlOWNlZjRkMzQyZDdhZjliYjI0MThiYmI3NTZh">Saffra kept her eyes closed, and she found one of them pried open.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjhlNjhjYTRiMzRlNjdiMDEzM2EzNjE2NjA5ZjQ0">“It’s polite to look at someone when they’re talking to you.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMThlZjYzYmM3NTQ4Yzk4NDc5OGNjMzBmYzhmNTQ0">Saffra stared numbly at her in response. It wasn’t like she could talk. The rag stuffed in her mouth tasted disgusting.</p>
<p class="cnNmODBlYmYyOWQyNjQwNmNiMzcyN2E1ZTk5NmExNjU4">“I’m positive nothing gave it away, I’ve been doing this a while. Kinda irks me that some brat saw through me so easily.” Her grip tightened on her chin, fingernails digging in, and she shook Saffra’s head back and forth, just because she could. She sighed and released her, sitting back on her heels. “You’re a bad actor, for the record. I might’ve convinced myself all that glaring back at the guild was for some other reason. But I felt your eyes on me through the entire mission too. You didn’t want to come out here, plain as day. If you’re putting up an act, <em>you can never drop it</em>.” She tapped Saffra on the nose. “Seems obvious, silly girl.”</p>
<p class="cnNkM2IyMWEwNGNkMzRhOGJhZTE0NmExZDFmZTc0NGZl">She considered Saffra.</p>
<p class="cnNkOWZkNjY5ZThjOTQ0ODg4ODllYmIyMTc0MTdlZjg4">“But really, did something give it away? I want to know.” Her jaw shifted back and forth. “I’d take out the gag to get an answer, but I know your type. You’d spit in my face. And then I’d have to hurt you. I don’t like hurting children, it makes me feel bad.” She laughed. “Hypocritical, I know.”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGUwNjU4NzY2NjRjNWRhZGYyY2UwNzJmMzliMGRh">She stood and dusted her hands.</p>
<p class="cnNkOTEyYTM4N2I0ODQ3ZDFhNWZlZTYxY2NiNDgyYmQ2">“What are we doing with the boy?” she asked Dominic.</p>
<p class="cnNjYWQ2NmNjYTM0NTRiMjQ5YzYzN2RlYjM1YmVhN2Ux">“It’d be easiest to kill him. Best price will be through the Cult.”</p>
<p class="cnM4YzViZmY0NmQ5ZDQzNzY5Zjc5MGYwMGY1YmQ5ZDIw">“An acolyte. Promising one too. He’ll fetch a good price.” She rubbed her chin. Allen had gone very still to Saffra’s side. She couldn’t look at him. “Can’t undo killing, though. Maybe best to hold off.”</p>
<p class="cnNhYzUyMWJlYWI3MDQzNjBiMjc4MjIxZWZmNzFmMmJk">“Opens us to divinations from the Temple. He’s one of theirs. Safer to kill.”</p>
<p class="cnM3YWRhNmUzNGQ5NzQxZDhiNjZlOGZjMzIwOGM4MDgz">“True.” She thought it over, then sighed. “You’re right, like usual.” She flicked her wrist to the side. “Deal with him.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNjU0ZDMxNjcxZDQ1N2FhMTQ4M2FkOTE5MzcxMjhl">Dominic started walking to Allen, and Saffra began struggling again. Not that she could do anything.</p>
<p class="cnM1YzdiMGIzOGE0ZjRiZTVhZDcwYjg0YzhjMDRhMTY1">“What I don’t understand,” Lailah said, crouching back down near Saffra, “is why you came out here anyway. I really don’t get it. To investigate us?” She shook her head with amusement. “What you should<em> </em>have done was listen to your gut. Talk to the Guild, maybe. But you didn’t. I watched you from the start, since I knew you were onto something. You just skulked around.” She laughed. “When you’re in over your head, silly girl, ask for help. <em>Warn</em> someone.”</p>
<p class="cnMxOGY4ZWYwMzU0YjQ5NmM5ODNlYTE3Y2ZhMTdiNjNk">Saffra slumped into the ground, fighting the nausea in her stomach.</p>
<p class="cnNhZmRmNjQxODkzMTRlNWVhYWYxNzA0Y2FjNGI0NDY5">Lailah was right. Why had she been so stupid?</p>
<p class="cnM3Y2E2NTA1ZjZlMjQxOTQ5Y2RlNTkwNmQzMGUwN2Qw">Then a voice that didn’t belong cut through the air, startling all four of them.</p>
<p class="cnM1NDQ5ZGMwMGJiYzRlNTI5OGQ1NmVlOTJhNDBkZTU0">“For the record. She did warn someone.”</p>

## Chapter 8: 8 - Hope


                <p class="cnM3Y2NkYjI2ZWM0MjQyZjViOTdlMTUzZmE2YTdhZGRh">Saffra’s gaze snapped in the direction of the voice, like everyone’s did.</p>
<p class="cnM2OWZlNjE4OWQ3MzQxYjRhMTVkMGZkYTliNTQ3YzJj">Lailah in particular had drawn two daggers and dropped into a combat position in the time it took Saffra to blink. She had suspected the woman had been faking her rank—she hadn’t seemed like a silver—but that confirmed it. The movement had been unnaturally fluid, showcasing the sort of grace she had only seen on high-rank adventurers.</p>
<p class="cnNkMjdlMTMyNzA1NTQ1Y2M4ZTQzMTljNWQ2OWI5NGUz">There was a demon standing a half-dozen feet away. She wore plain black robes and held a gnarled staff of gray wood. Her hood was thrown back, revealing a seemingly young face wearing such a contemptuously bored expression, red eyes flat and uninterested, mouth downturned the slightest amount, that Saffra felt condescended to, somehow, just by being in her presence.</p>
<p class="cnNhMGMwZDgxY2ExMDRjOTI4YjIyNjIzNTA1NmIyMGMz">Despite her apparent youth, Saffra had the instant impression she was in the presence of someone—<em>something</em>—old and dangerous. Her gut instincts were usually right.</p>
<p class="cnNiYzk4YWVlYTUxNTRkOTE5MTI4YjA3NmE1YTdkYjY3">It was the woman she’d met earlier. The newcomer mage Lailah had invited. What was she doing here? It was such a confusing turn of events Saffra didn’t even feel relief.</p>
<p class="cnNkMWQxMDBjN2M5MTQ3MzA4NDk2ZDQ2ZWJmMzQ5YzQ2">Lailah slowly straightened out, clearly on edge. So was Dominic, hand on the hilt of his axe as he watched the development carefully.</p>
<p class="cnM3NjA4ZTU0Y2I5NzRlY2Q4MDM1NzMyY2NhZGVjNjJh">Allen started squirming and trying to call something out through his gag. Dominic looked over and almost seemed like he was going to kick him, but he refrained, turning to eye the stranger instead.</p>
<p class="cnM3MTk3MzA5ZjE0ODQ2MzU4YjY4MjU2NDBkNzc5N2U5">What had her name been?</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWIyYmM0OGEzZTQ5NTZiMDA5ODE0NDZhYmU3Y2Iz">“Vivi, right?” Lailah asked. “Didn’t expect to run into you out here.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NDI4YWFmYjVhMDRhODVhYzFlMzZhNGI0OWFmZTIy">“Invisibility is a tier seven spell,” Dominic said, his tone clipped.</p>
<p class="cnM4OGExMGQ4YWU0NjRiYzZhZTc2MTc5ZjZhZDUyM2Q4">Lailah shot a glare at her partner. “It wasn’t invisibility. Glamour, or something like that.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MTY4ZmYyYTBlNzQ5MDQ5OTcwZTY2ZTBmZTNiYWU2">The demon didn’t react. Saffra found herself captured by the utter lack of worry in her eyes. And the slight disdain leaking through, which probably spoke of <em>complete and utter </em>disdain, considering how little her face seemed to emote.</p>
<p class="cnNiN2FkYWFiYjVhMzQxYzU5NGMxOTA2OWI5ZTkwN2Ri">Saffra remembered being slightly unnerved in her conversation with the woman, even if she’d never felt <em>worried</em>. She’d known the demon was dangerous, but not dangerous in a bad way. Not like Lailah, despite being ten times as suspicious on the surface.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzRhODBjYTVmOTQyYWJhOWIwMmVlMTJiN2E2MTA0">But [Invisibility]? It was indeed a tier seven spell, something only mages averaging level seven hundred could cast. Saffra would know. She was Institute-educated, if only briefly, now expelled.</p>
<p class="cnM5Njg0MGY1NDNhYzRlNzM4ZGU5OGU4MDdjYmVlYmVi">Level seven hundred. Solidly into mithril rank. Which meant, if that were true, the demon could handle two low golds…probably. Mages weren’t great duelists. Especially not two-on-one. And that assumed her opponents were, in fact, low golds and not higher.</p>
<p class="cnNkNDcxMjMzZjNiZjQwODI5OGJlZjk4M2FjYzQyMjk3">On top of that, it might not<em> </em>have been invisibility, and instead some other spell or skill. Lailah’s suggestion of a [Glamour] or [Illusion] wasn’t far-fetched.</p>
<p class="cnNiNDMwM2I5ZDk5MTRkODRiZTk4ZWJkMTkxMTYwZjll">The demon briefly ignored the two adults as her red eyes slid over to Saffra. “I apologize for the delay. I came and watched at the start, but nothing was happening, so I returned to town.”</p>
<p class="cnNjOWJmMzM3NzA1MjRhZTM5YzdlYjhkZWM4MjJjZjUw">She…came and watched? How? She hadn’t sensed anyone following them, and obviously Lailah and Dominic hadn’t. That definitely implied an invisibility or equally strong stealth spell.</p>
<p class="cnMxYTM5ODNhMzIwMDQ1ODc5ODI1ZTQ2Y2NjNWEyYmFi">And how had she known to return, if she’d gone back to town? [Farsight]? That was high-level magic too, though not as high as [Invisibility].</p>
<p class="cnMwMjBlZGNmNmZiYTRkZjg4YzYzMWMxNWVkYWY0ZDli">It probably ought to be disturbing, knowing someone had been spying on her, but Saffra was only now feeling the barest tinges of hope.</p>
<p class="cnMxZjFjMjI4NjY4ODQxMzc5ODE2YjNhNWE1NGY3Mzgz">She stamped down on that feeling. A person couldn’t trust in one miracle. Was she really about to get a second in her lifetime? She didn’t dare let herself believe.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTgxNjJhZTUxZjQ2MzRhNDdjNzQxMGZiYzI3NzZi">Still, at the demon’s words, the surge of repressed hope made her eyes start watering. She hunched forward, staring at the ground so she didn’t lose her composure entirely.</p>
<p class="cnMyZThhMTFkOTI1MDRmZDliZjczMmFmZDQ4NGIxODdm">The demon grew agitated by that, for some reason. Her red eyes locked on Lailah, and Saffra swore she could feel the air thicken, like it was responding to the woman’s anger.</p>
<p class="cnMzODdlZGJhZWRlZDQ2NDhiZTdmYjc2NDU4MWRlMmQx">“Why?” she demanded.</p>
<p class="cnMzMDNmOTJjMjhjODRjZDU5ZTllNDdlOWZhZGI4OTAw">The green-haired woman seemed to debate the pros and cons of trying to talk her way out of the situation. A few seconds passed, and she shrugged. Tossed her hair back and spun her daggers.</p>
<p class="cnMzMGY2ODRiZmY0ZjQ3ZjFhNTY1YzEyODZjMjFlMmM3">“Pays well. Nothing more, nothing less. Have to make ends meet, don’t I?” She sighed, as if exhausted by her own argument. “Let’s get this over with. You clearly don’t know who you’re up against.”</p>
<p class="cnMxY2U2MTQyYjA2OTQ5YjdhYmZiNzk5ODBhM2U3MWE1">And despite the impression that this demon mage was competent, possibly even mithril rank, something cold gripped Saffra.</p>
<p class="cnMwMTllYmYzMzcwNDQwNGE5ZjAzNDZjN2Q4MjU0YzQy">Because she wasn’t sure her savior would win. Had Saffra lured someone to her death? And worse, an apparently good<em> </em>person, willing to risk herself for a stranger? There had been no obligation to follow them into the forest. She had come out of a desire to help. Those sorts of people were rare. And Saffra might have gotten her killed.</p>
<p class="cnMwODBmZWM4ZjgwYjRmNjk5NWU4ZmE3NDI3MmFkMGM5">Daggers drawn, Lailah dashed forward faster than Saffra could perceive, practically [Blinking] in front of the demon mage. Black metal blades scraped against a prismatic shield—but were repulsed, throwing Lailah back.</p><span class="cjAwMDUwNTRhNTRiMzRkYmM4NzIwMmM1NDg1MjQ1ZGUz"><br>The tale has been illicitly lifted; should you spot it on Amazon, report the violation.<br></span>
<p class="cnNjZjYzOTk3ZGUyZDQwNDFiN2FlYTJkMTJjZjQ0MTFj">At the same instant, a lazy flick of Vivi’s wrist had a blast of air slamming into Dominic, who had charged at the same instant, his axe raised. He went careening head-over-heels, throwing up clumps of dirt and grass, cracking a felled log in half as he tumbled. He staggered to his feet, seeming uninjured, but was clearly startled by the strength of the attack.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDVhNjU4MzJkYjRiYTA4NzFiZjE2Yzc5YWVjN2I0">It made Vivi’s two opponents reevaluate her.</p>
<p class="cnM2YjJlMGJiOTZlNjQyZjk5MDk5ODdhNWU0YTQ2MTNj">“Not a pushover, are you?” Lailah asked. “Damn. Was kind of hoping.” Her jaw worked left and right. Vivi didn’t seem eager to retaliate, but her expression was cold enough to freeze over the Ashen Hierophant’s lair. “Sure we can’t work something out? Cut you in, maybe?”</p>
<p class="cnM5NjczNDY5MDUwODQ1YTc5OTkzODFmMTAxZTk0YjQ5">The demon’s head tilted slightly, and something stuck in Saffra’s throat despite all logic.</p>
<p class="cnNlZTk1YTY3YjhiNzQxZDhhOTVhMDQ0ZTA2ZjcxNjNh">She wouldn’t, right?</p>
<p class="cnM1YTAzNjVjMjZlZTQ3M2ZiNmE2NGEzYzM5OGJkYzNj">But Saffra had faced more than one betrayal. Maybe the demon <em>was</em> considering the offer. While she had blocked their first coordinated attack, their speed had been incredible. Were these two even gold ranks? Or had they been faking from an even higher position than Saffra had assumed? Were they mithril themselves?</p>
<p class="cnM4NGRkMjdiNzJmMTQ1ODU4MTU4OTU4NzgyNzg2NjYw">With that sort of realization, Saffra wouldn’t even blame the demon for accepting the offer. Better to come out with her own life. They were strangers; they owed each other nothing.</p>
<p class="cnNlMWY2ZWIwZTMxMDQwNzk4NzRjYWJiNGMwNTk2YmUx">“I won’t kill you,” the demon said flatly. “But I <em>will</em> enjoy this.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMWNiOTBlYjkwZTQ1NDViMDVkMTJiZDhkMDFjMjk1">Another contemptuous wave of Vivi’s staff resulted in a deafening <em>boom</em> that had Dominic crashing through trees and foliage, disappearing into the forest.</p>
<p class="cnM2YzQwNTBiMDRlYzQxNDBiYWE2M2VjYmViOWM3NGYy">It wasn’t anything comparable to the previous blast of air. One second the man was standing there, the next, a hole had been punched through the forest, Dominic a sudden projectile.</p>
<p class="cnM5YjVhZDRkNDBmOTRmZWE5Y2NmMjFhZjg1MWIzODdj">What?</p>
<p class="cnNlNGM3ZGYxY2ZiYjQwNmQ4ZDhmM2IwOGU3NjZjNTJl">What had that spell even been?</p>
<p class="cnM1ZWRmMDA5NjA2ZTQ5MTVhMjcwNjIzOThkOTk0OTg3">How had she cast it so fast?</p>
<p class="cnMxNWMwM2U5MmYwYzQxMzlhM2IwOGI0NDg0MzI2YjM4">The weakness of mages was the build-up required for their more powerful spells. Hence why they weren’t effective duelists.</p>
<p class="cnNmNTRlYTlmNGQ0NzQ5YTM4YmVjNjlkOTVhYmFkZTI0">And yet—?</p>
<p class="cnM4OTgzMGUwYTA1MjRkZWVhOWE0YmViNzE0NmI1MGJj">Lailah looked at the destruction caused by her teammate pulverizing a trail through the forest, her face going pale. Facing Vivi, her eyes sharpened.</p>
<p class="cnNiZjVlOTEzNmY4ZTQ3OTZiYzQ1ZmZmNmI1NmNkNzVk">“Guess I have to take this seriously.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NjlkODQ5MTNiMDQzZWViOGMxYmZkMmQ5YmE0Mzg0">Saffra wasn’t sure how much more her heart could take. Her appraisal of the situation had changed too many times back and forth. The resolve in Lailah’s voice, despite seeing that ridiculous spell, once more created terror in Saffra. She still thought she had a chance.</p>
<p class="cnM4MjdhZTBmYWJmYjQzYWFiYjU1MjExMGZhM2YxN2Fk">While Lailah was wearing a silver badge, she obviously wasn’t one…nor a gold, at this point. Mithril? Even upper mithril? Higher? Surely not. Orichalcums were adventurers known through the kingdom, second only to the extremely rare Titled.</p>
<p class="cnM0NzI5MDIwMzY5NjQ1YWFiYzBiZTZhNTFjZTYyYzQ2">Could Saffra really expect a random adventurer to win against two mithrils? No matter who they were?</p>
<p class="cnM0OWQ0MzFlNmVmYTRhYzViZDNjZTg3ZDBjYTE3M2Jm">Saffra couldn’t even perceive what happened. One moment Lailah’s figure flickered, the next she was lying in a freshly born crater a dozen feet forward, crushed down by some enormous force. There had been…some sort of exchange, she intuited, if a brief one. She just hadn’t been able to see it.</p>
<p class="cnM2OTQ5NjExOGFkODQxZTliZTBmMzhkOTZjMmRkNjNl">“You aren’t the weakest,” Vivi said, in what was maybe a compliment despite the condescension in her voice. “The spell resisted for a second. That disgusts me more. You’re strong enough to do what you want. Why this?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NjE4MDk4OGQ1NTQ3ZjA4MWQwMjMxNjk3YzQ0NDU5">Lailah laughed, but it wasn’t pleasant. Her facade had dropped. “Don’t look down on me, you bitch.” She struggled onto her knees and forearms, resisting the force. “What…the hell are you?” She grimaced, buckling and flattening out. “Where did you even come from?” she groaned.</p>
<p class="cnMxNWM2NDNhMGJlMDQ5NTdiZTRiZTQ2ZTg5NDliMDdh">The demon’s eyes were cold. Her staff dropped, dispelling the force. Lailah didn’t waste the opportunity. She was on her feet and in front of the demon in an instant, and she—</p>
<p class="cnNkODllZWFjZjU5YjQyMmRiNDFhOTVjNDI0NGVjZWEz">A cracking like a whip, and an explosion of air.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZjY1ZTYzN2MyODQ1MDBiNDkzNGYyNGI3ZmYwNGEz">Lailah was gone. She’d been sent tearing through the forest like her partner earlier. Slammed into by some enormous kinetic force.</p>
<p class="cnM1MzgyYTE4N2RiZjRhMDA4N2Q2MDc3MjIzMDY5OWU4">The warrior of the party returned a moment later. Dominic, bloodied and bruised, yet as grim-faced as always. Lightning crackled around his raised axe as he bore down on the demon with some skill, obviously one of his stronger ones. Each step seemed to cross twice the distance it should. The ground shook as he charged.</p>
<p class="cnMzZjMxZjdjMTFmMjQzMmViMmZkOTExYzY2OTlkZGQw">Saffra was even worried for a second. He didn’t have the same speed as Lailah, but he was far more durable. Maybe he would—?</p>
<p class="cnNjZDY3NzNkNjlhNTRlNzA4OTkxZmQ4MTQzMmM4ODk3">Once more, he was swatted away as if by the hand of a vengeful god.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzc2ZWI3MzdkYjRkZmNhZmNkMDBjNGRkYTNjNDFk">This…wasn’t even a fight, Saffra realized.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDNmMGFkYmI4NzRjNmZiMThlMGRjNmM2ZWRkMmJl">These had to be mithril-ranks. How were they being<em> toyed with?</em></p>
<p class="cnMyNjFiZjFkYjg4YjQ1ZDRhOTI3OGE4NDQ5M2EzNjYz">“Now you’re running?” Vivi asked, red eyes snapping in a seemingly random direction as she watched something deep in the forest that Saffra couldn’t see. “Have some shame.”</p>
<p class="cnNhZTE4MzEyNGEzNzRiNWRhNDg4NDRkMjA1YzZkNDU2">Something happened. Saffra couldn’t describe what. She didn’t have the magical foundation to describe what her senses told her. The demon was just gone. But not with the signature of an [Invisibility] spell, or with overwhelming physical speed.</p>
<p class="cnM2MTI5NjNkYmRmYzRhMzhiNjUwNDRkYmE3NjIwNjQy">…Spatial warping? A guess based on contextual evidence, not an understanding of what had happened on a magical level.</p>
<p class="cnM4N2FkNjEwNmE5YTQ2N2Y4ZjViNWI5ZjE3NGJiOTRj">More than anything she’d seen so far, that stunned her.</p>
<p class="cnNjMmRiYTJjOGZiZjQwODM4M2YxZDllNTIwNjEyMmE5">[Blink]?</p>
<p class="cnNmOGNiNDMxYTk3MzQ5YjRiMmQ0ZTJkNTE0YTdhMWMw">Teleportation spells, even the weakest and shortest range ones, were higher-tier than [Invisibility]. Ninth, she believed?</p>
<p class="cnNkYjY3NDMwNDdmNTQxNzRhZWYwOGRmNTMwMjMwMmYy">This woman. She was <em>at least</em> orichalcum-rank.</p>
<p class="cnM0NjUwNzkyYzZjODRlMmE4NjllODc5ZGE0YTkxNWRm">And she’d cast it without Saffra hearing an invocation or seeing a spell-circle summoned. Within a second.</p>
<p class="cnMxMzY1Mjc3YjgxNTQ5NGE4YTFlNTgyYTVjNTY1Njc2">…Emphasis on ‘at least’.</p>
<p class="cnNkMjc0ZDkxNGQwMzQzZmZhZGQ3MDU1MTU4NTNiOTIw">Just what was<em> </em>this monster?</p>
<p class="cnNlZDY3MGViNmY1NzQ0YTU5NWRhM2E2OTg4NDUzOTJi">Could even her best instructors at the Institute cast super high-tier magic this fluidly? Could the headmaster, or one of the archmages? The Institute featured some of the world’s best mages,<em> </em>orichalcum rank and above, even if they weren’t adventurers and had never passed the qualification exams.</p>
<p class="cnMxODA0MDBlMTk2OTQyMDc5YmU3OTFlZDczNzVhYTgx">The demon popped back into existence a moment later. Her staff was pointed at a floating Lailah. With a jerk of her wrist and a slam downward, the woman impacted the forest floor and spawned another small crater.</p>
<p class="cnMyY2I0YmM4MjIzNzQ1MGVhZDZjNThjODA2YWE1MzFh">Then another spell, cast without invocation or circle, and roots erupted from the ground and wrapped around the rogue, holding her in place.</p>
<p class="cnMxYmY5NTk5Yjk4NzQ0OTc5MDRmNjAyMTUzZGU2YjJm"><em>Pop</em>. The demon was gone. She reappeared with a second prisoner in tow. Dominic received the same treatment.</p>
<p class="cnM2OWRkNjQwZjFjODQwN2Y5ODRmNjhjZDczZTRhN2Zl">Vivi gazed down at them for a moment. She nodded in satisfaction. Then turned to Saffra.</p>
<p class="cnNhZDI0ZDc0OTRmZjRlYjE4NzU4NjRjZDc2MjdlOGRh">Saffra felt herself stiffen. Even if this woman was her savior, what she had seen had invoked an instinctual terror. The sort an ant felt when a bear came stomping through the forest, his path of destruction headed straight for her. This creature could kill her by accident, a tertiary side-effect of her laziest movements.</p>
<p class="cnNiYzg4ODVlOTgyYjRmODViNmFhOGU2NWYwYjk1M2E3">She crouched down next to Saffra.</p>
<p class="cnM4MWMwZjE3OGYxYTRhMDQ5OWI2NDE4YTgxOGY1Nzc2">“My apologies,” she said softly. “I should have trusted your instincts.”</p>
<p class="cnNmNWJmYzQ1YjA1ZDQyYWE5YTZmNTJmZDU5NDJlMDcx">A vague gesture had the cloth stuffed in Saffra’s mouth cut in half and thrown aside. The same with her other bindings. She spat the taste out of her mouth, scooting instinctively away from the demon.</p>
<p class="cnMxZjE4ZTlhNGNhZTRkNTBiNDI5ZGZlODQzZWM4Mjk5">The demon raised her hands, signaling she wasn’t a threat, and Saffra instantly felt like dirt.</p>
<p class="cnMyNjI1M2JiN2QwYjRiMWRhOTAxYmEwOTIzNzQ4YjMy">She did the mature thing and burst into tears.</p>
<p class="cnMwYWI1MmUyYTgwMTQxMzM4ZGRjNTM4NDFhYjE3NzYy">She really hated herself for that. But the events of the past ten minutes—had it even been that long?—were too overwhelming. The horror, the hope, the relief in rapid succession.</p>
<p class="cnNmYmQ0MDcyZjQ5YjQxZWRhYjc1NjAzODQxYmI1OWYz">The concern on the demon’s face added another layer: hilarity. Why would she care that Saffra was crying? It was way too humanizing of an expression for someone who had torn through a pair of mithril ranks like paper.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzZkMmQ4NDg2ODRkNTg4NDYzMWQzMDJjOTdiN2Yz">She wiped the tears away, trying to control herself, but ultimately failed. The demon reached out again, the movement unsure, but Saffra scooted away a second time, shaking her head.</p>
<p class="cnNmYjllNGE0NTJiNDQwMThhNjM0ZjU1YzRkZDZjNzhh">The demon hesitated, then gave up, and instead went to free Allen.</p>
<p class="cnM4NDI0NDhiY2RjNTQ2ZTM5MzdhNTc2YzI3NDBjNzIy">Saffra tucked her head between her knees and berated herself until she wasn’t bawling like a child anymore.</p>

## Chapter 9: 9 - Secure


                <p class="cnM5YzYyMmIxYjFmYzRjZmFhMmFiN2Y1MjI0NWQzNDVh">Taking care of the two pieces of scum had been easy enough, but the aftermath was harder.</p>
<p class="cnMzNWM4NzE2ODljOTRjNDRhZDQ3NjkxMGY0ZjExMjRk">Vivi wasn’t good with people. She wasn’t the <em>worst</em>, maybe, but it had never been her strong suit. Neither was dealing with the aftermath of a traumatizing situation.</p>
<p class="cnMyNWJkN2ZjYjhmOTRjNWM5MzMwYTc2OTUzMTIzNjFl">Allen handled it better than Saffra. He was a grown adult, if a young one. And even he was more than a little rattled. Vivi helped him to his feet, and he smoothed his robes out ten or twelve more times than necessary.</p>
<p class="cnM0OGYxNjRiZmIwNDQwNWZhNmYyMDU3ZjVmODQwMmFj">He crouched down next to Saffra and tried to assure her, with slightly more success than Vivi had managed. She tried not to let it affect her how the girl didn’t flinch away from him like she had from her.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGQxMWFkZWIzNDRmMTFiZTdlZjllODU5NDFhMDY3">In the meantime, she cast a restraining spell better suited for transportation. White bands of light wrapped around her two prisoners’ arms, legs, and torsos. And their mouths. She wasn’t sure what she would do if they said the wrong thing right now. Her temper was beyond frayed. She’d never been so disgusted in her life.</p>
<p class="cnNmZTBjMzQ3YTYxYTQ0NDM4ZGMzMzJmYjRjMDkxZjc3">It was the first instance having so much power at her fingertips made her uneasy rather than filled her with awe. She’d been quick to start throwing the man and woman around. The difference between them was so great that she could have ended the conflict without violence, but she’d chosen to hurt them instead. What did that say about her?</p>
<p class="cnNhOTVhNzU2NTk3MDQzNDM4MTE1N2UwYzI5NjdkZDAy">Another application of [Greater Telekinesis] later, and two bodies were floating in front of her staff.</p>
<p class="cnNhM2ZjNmRhYTk2ZTRiNmJiNGFhNDJkZmIxODA2NzM4">“We should return to the city. Hand them in to the guard. You two weren’t hurt, right?”</p>
<p class="cnNkNzdjNGMyMmNiNDRmOWY4Y2U1ZTg5MWM3MDVkYTNk">Allen checked himself over, then looked at Saffra. Saffra didn’t look at him; she stared at the ground and silently shook her head. Another surge of anger and frustration filled Vivi, though it didn’t touch her face.</p>
<p class="cnMzZDU0YWFhYzE1YjQ0NWZiODVhZTM1NWQ4ODM4MmFk">This poor girl didn’t deserve any of this. Not that Allen did either, but Saffra seemed more shaken than him. She <em>was </em>only thirteen, or thereabouts.</p>
<p class="cnNiMGRhNWZkZjJkYTQ4MzFhNmYzMWIwOGNkOTEwNzBl">This event had been a wake-up call. She might have found herself transported into a new world, but it was a ‘fantasy world’ only in the sense of the environment and a few fundamental rules of nature. People were still people. Some were good, some were bad, and some were—worse than bad.</p>
<p class="cnMyMmM3ZGI5MTg3MDQ0MTI5YTU4ZDZmYzhhZjFlYjlk">“Let’s go, then,” Vivi said.</p>
<p class="cnNlYzYwZDM2MDhiODQ3NzdhOWU0NDM3NmNiZmNkZTMy">She could teleport their entire party back if she pleased, but she still wanted to lie low, regardless of how unlikely that was becoming. More importantly, these two needed a chance to gather their thoughts. They weren’t far from Prismarche’s walls; the walk would do them good.</p>
<p class="cnNhZmUyMjMzYmExMDQ5YTlhNzNiZGEyNDFlODNlMTM5">She floated the two prisoners ahead, bound and gagged by magic. A number of monsters contested their progress, but she was in no mood to play around, so they died the instant they appeared.</p>
<p class="cnNiMDA5OTc5MWI2YjRkYjY5YmJkMzczZWViOWE5ODg4">Saffra rallied throughout the walk, to Vivi’s relief, her shoulders squaring and chin raising in that cutely arrogant way Vivi had first seen in the Adventurer’s Guild. But even she could tell it was feigned.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZGQ0MTA1NTI1OTQ0NThhNDY2ZTgxNmE5ZGI3NDAy">Being in a headspace to even feign<em> </em>composure was an improvement from the way she’d crumpled into herself earlier. Vivi’s grip tightened around her staff, remembering that sight.</p>
<p class="cnNhOGM4ODk0MDE3MTQ3Y2JiNmI3MDA5MjE4ODVkY2E2">The following two hours were a chore. Reasonable for how Vivi had taken prisoners, the gate guards contested their entry; she explained the situation. They were brought to the guardhouse; she explained the situation. She escorted the growing party to the holding cells; she explained the situation to yet more people.</p>
<p class="cnM5N2RlOTVhNTI2NzRmZTk4ZGQ0NGMxNmEzYjdjYzRj">Her irritation might have started to show, because Allen took over. While her junior, he understood the system better than she did anyway. He was better suited to dealing with this.</p>
<p class="cnM0NjA3OGRjNTJhNTQxM2M4NmI5MDUzYTYwOTg0MmJh">The higher-ups dragged in to deal with the criminals—the criminals who were still floating in the air gagged and restrained by bindings of glowing white light—were extremely interested in Vivi’s involvement. Or rather, who she was, why she’d helped, and what rank she was. Not that she was answering. They seemed more interested in her than the matter at hand, which rapidly agitated her, and she hadn’t been in a good mood to begin with.</p>
<p class="cnM2YjNiY2ViNzJiZjQwYzdiOWQ0NzI5ODI1YmE5NjNj">Thankfully, the Guard Captain—since this was a significant enough event to call the highest ranked officer in the city to the scene—sensed her growing annoyance and called off the scrutiny.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGJmZjViYWUyZjQ3ZTA5ZDg1MTI0ODk0Y2M1OTkx">“You’ve done our city a great service, Lady Adventurer,” the regal-looking man, who was probably a nobleman of some flavor, said, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. Soren, she thought he’d been introduced as? She’d heard a lot of names in the past twenty minutes. “I thank you personally for rescuing two of our own and securing such detestable criminals.”</p>
<p class="cnMyZDBlYjQzZmJjMDRlMTZiYzljYzNjNDVhY2I4MzQx">Vivi eyed him. The words seemed earnest despite the fanfare. “I’ve said what I need to. Make sure they’re taken care of.” She waved at Allen and Saffra to indicate who she meant. “I’ll be going now.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NDBiOTgwMzkyOTRhZTliOGUyOWQ0MDJhOWI4ZWEy">No one stopped her. Though the guards posted at the door shot a sharp look at the Guard Captain, who inclined his head in permission.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjA4NTMwYTY1NDQ4OGU5NGJhMjAyYmQyZjI4Njlk">Out under the open sky, Vivi took a calming breath. She walked around the nearest corner, checked for anyone watching, then wrapped herself in [Invisibility], [Blinked] into the sky, and [Blinked] several more times.</p>
<p class="cnM2NDk1M2VjMWRjMjQzYTVhZjhkMGM4ODIwZmZiZWU2">She set down onto the roof of the Adventurer’s Guild. Sitting, she tucked her chin onto her knees and finally had a chance to ruminate over the situation.</p>
<p class="cnMxZjA5YTQ1NWQ2NzRmZDJiNWE3MGNmZjk2NTg1YWFh">There was a lot she could have done better. That she wished she had done better. Namely her slow response.</p>
<p class="cnNmMzc4MWI5MTFjMzQwZTBiMzkyOWY3NDU5YmE4MGRk">After an hour of nothing happening with Lailah and her team, she had shrugged and headed back to town. She hadn’t abandoned the possibility that something might go wrong, since she had been casting frequent [Farsight] spells, but when the situation had developed such that Vivi realized with a shock that she <em>was </em>needed, she hadn’t been able to teleport there instantly.</p>
<p class="cnM5YTg4Mzg3NDM2OTQ4M2FiMmE4NzYyZGExMjc1YTg5">Her supreme magical might wasn’t all that supreme, not in the sense she was omnipotent. She had limitations—plenty of them. She could repeatedly cast [Blink] to cover enormous distances, but first she needed to be aware of the problem, and secondly, rapid movement wasn’t instant. It had taken time. Not much, but time nonetheless.</p>
<p class="cnNkNzQ1NDEzYmY0MjQ3OWY4ZTFiMjMyM2Q3MzgyNjkx">It was a strange mix of emotions she felt. The unexpected part was relief, and she didn’t mean relief for having saved Allen and Saffra. Thus far, she had felt a sort of…surreal detachment experiencing this new life. How couldn’t she? It was absurd what had happened. The generous way everyone had treated her so far had reinforced that feeling: that it was all a fantasy.</p><span class="cjJmZmVjZmVmYWY1NjRmYzQ4MDM0ZDkyYjBjMDM0ZDQx"><br>Ensure your favorite authors get the support they deserve. Read this novel on Royal Road.<br></span>
<p class="cnMxNjlhOTI2OTJkNDRkNTZhZGY2MDFjZGQ3NDVkMGY1">This had grounded her in a way few things could have. No, she hadn’t arrived in an idealized world where nothing went wrong. A teenager and a young man had likely been traumatized by her slow reaction. She had possessed enough information and reasonable suspicion that she could have prevented the events before they escalated. Yet today had turned out as it had. And she was responsible.</p>
<p class="cnM4MDNjMTY0YmMyZTQ1MjZhNWNlOTA2NGMzZmFmOTFj">Vivi wasn’t used to responsibility. She was all but a shut-in. She played video games most of the day every day, eking out a living through the videos she posted online—since some small contingent of people were interested in the musings, advice, and commentary of the highest-ranked player of one of the world’s most popular games, no matter how uncharismatically delivered.</p>
<p class="cnMzMDFhN2JhNGNiOTQzOTRhYzU2OWI4ZWJkYTM4ZTRi">Even that level of attention had been uncomfortable. She’d released videos only often enough to make payments on her one-bedroom apartment.</p>
<p class="cnNhY2QwZTRiODQyZTQzNTBhMjdmYzAxYWNhYWQ0YWNk">It was no surprise that the first important event in her new life, she’d messed up.</p>
<p class="cnM0OWYyMmRjNjFkZjRkM2ZiOTg0YWFjZTM1YjRiZjg2">She sighed and collapsed backward, staring at the sky. The shroud of [Invisibility] was strangely comforting. It might be her favorite spell. There had been a lot of times she’d wished she could disappear, and now she could.</p>
<p class="cnM4YjQ1ZTBjODc5MzRjNDk5YzVjNWJlYjRhYTMxZTQ0">An hour passed as she festered. A cloud hung over her. She contemplated everything she should have done differently.</p>
<p class="cnNiZjc2ZDM1ZTJhZjRkNTZiY2Q0MDJiZDAyODQzZDEz">She wasn’t the sort to stew forever though. Eventually she heaved out another huge sigh, sat up, and rubbed her sore neck. Apparently stats didn’t save a person from what made them human.</p>
<p class="cnNjZjVmMzAyNDBmNzQ5ZGE4ZDE2YmE0NDc5YWNkNDll">…or demon?</p>
<p class="cnNjYTQxNmZjNjIwOTQ3YmE4Yzk4MDhiOWMyNjBlZTQy">She slid down the roof and landed in front of the Adventurer’s Guild.</p>
<p class="cnM1NjExZDczMzhlMDQxYjg5ZWY5Njc4ZWMyMGQ3NmEz">By divine timing, a teenage catgirl was stalking out the front door. She didn’t see Vivi, on account of [Invisibility], of course.</p>
<p class="cnM2MDNmMjRmYTA1ZjQ1OGU5YTQwZWEwZmQ3M2E1MDI0">She watched her go, wondering if she should say something, but decided against it. Better if that poor girl forgot the whole ordeal.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjMyYThjOTQ2YTRjNDA5NzVkNTY2NDI1ZDU5OTRm">Even if Vivi had mishandled everything, the worst case scenario had been avoided. She tried not to think about what the ‘worst case’ would have been. She didn’t know who those two were, and honestly preferred not to.</p>
<p class="cnNiNjA1OGQxYWVmYzQ3Y2E5MTcxMjhmYmZkM2NkOTZh">She swerved into an alleyway, checked for spectators, and dispelled [Invisibility]. She walked into the Adventurer’s Guild.</p>
<p class="cnM1YTcwYWFiNjdhMzRmMTc4Yjk1NzVjNGU5NDUyYjhi">To her dismay, the Guildmaster and the Guard Captain were both inside, speaking with each other. Their eyes locked on Vivi the moment she walked through.</p>
<p class="cnMyMzc0ZWI2OGM3ZjQxOGI5YWIyYWI3ODAyNGFmYzRl">She suppressed her annoyance and approached them herself, since it was obvious she would be flagged down if she didn’t.</p>
<p class="cnMxMjA5NjViODZhZDRlNjZhNDlkYWE0ZmIzOTk3N2Jm">She surprised herself when she was the one to open the conversation. “The girl. Where is she going?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMmM0NDkyMWFmNjQ1NWM5NGFkMjQ0ODE5NWJhZDY0">Saffra ought to be resting and recuperating, even if she hadn’t been physically harmed. Why had she been stalking straight back out into the city?</p>
<p class="cnNjZWQ1NTk5N2Q4MDQ4OWZhZDM2NGFiY2VlNDNlYWRk">Did she have family she was returning to? Somehow, Vivi doubted it. She had the impression Saffra was on her own. Not least because, who would let their young teenage daughter fight monsters for a living? But also just a general intuition.</p>
<p class="cnM5YTBkMGY5ZThjNTRhZDNiYzAzNDAxY2U1NjgxYTBm">She supposed she didn’t know much about Saffra’s circumstances, and she could be heading off anywhere, but Vivi asked the question anyway.</p>
<p class="cnNhYzRiZjExNzYyMDRjMGM4NmJiMWRhY2FjYWY4OWU2">The Guard Captain handled her demanding tone with grace, a quality she was quickly associating with him. She found herself annoyed for some reason. It reminded her of Lailah.</p>
<p class="cnMwZmJhNWJiNDYzMTQ3NGE4YTA4ZTY1OTAxZmM4NzJh">Maybe it wasn’t fair to compare any friendly person to that woman. Vivi had gotten unlucky, somehow bumping into her as one of the first people she’d met in this world.</p>
<p class="cnMwOWIxZGE3OGYyYzQ4Njg5YTMxYzc2NjA1OWQ0YmM0">“We insisted she stay and rest, but she insisted otherwise, and it would be inappropriate to detain her even for her own wellbeing,” Guard Captain Soren said. "She has committed no crimes and is in command of her own decisions."</p>
<p class="cnNmMTUxMjk3ZDlkYjQ5MGFhNzBjNTI0MTg5ZDBmOTc4">“Why did she insist? Where is she going?”</p>
<p class="cnMyOTVlOTFjMzgwMzRmMzBhZTQ2OTIzMTk2YWQ0NWNm">“Something about…looking for a cat?” He seemed confused.</p>
<p class="cnM3NmM2YWU0MTkxNzRiNDY4MTI1NzE5MjJkZWQzNmNl">Vivi paused.</p>
<p class="cnNmM2E5NzUzMTFkZDQ1MDk5NmEwYTkxNDNhMjdlMjU1">A cat?</p>
<p class="cnNiOGE0YTk2ZjhjNzRhM2FhM2E3NGUxYjk1YmUwZGIy">She put two and two together. The first time Vivi had met her, Saffra had been handing out posters for a missing cat. She had quested off into the city to keep working on that previous goal of hers. Maybe she’d wanted to return to the familiar mission for peace of mind?</p>
<p class="cnMwY2IzNmM2MjEwOTQ5MTZiZjdiMjRjNzYyNzg0OGI2">Despite what Saffra had been through, her first instinct was to go and help someone else.</p>
<p class="cnMzMzViNGM2YjgzNzQ4NmE4NjQwNTcwMjQ2ZjhiNDM3">Vivi was immediately seething. It surprised her how quickly her temper returned. Both the Guildmaster and the Guard Captain took a step back.</p>
<p class="cnM3OTQ5MzE5N2M0NzQ5MTdhZGEzY2RmNGZlZjkxZTNl">“I see,” Vivi said tightly, and spun on a heel. She didn’t even know what she was heading out to do.</p>
<p class="cnMwODk3ZTNjM2UwMjRlY2JhYjdiNjg4NjQ4YmI4NjQ1">“Lady Adventurer,” the Guard Captain said. “There truly are some things we must discuss.”</p>
<p class="cnM1Njk5MDdiMzI3MDQ0NjNhYTg3NzdkNzk2ZTUzMDVm">She contemplated ignoring him, but eventually decided she shouldn’t. She turned and eyed him, but he wasn’t dissuaded by her expression. He inclined his head in half apology.</p>
<p class="cnM4MjAyMzcwNjQ5YzRhNWVhM2Y1YWViMzQ4ZGI0YzBh">His continued congeniality forced Vivi to take a breath, especially since his regalia and attitude suggested he was a particularly high-ranking individual. Maybe he was conceding his station, somewhat, being so friendly and yielding to an unknown adventurer.</p>
<p class="cnNkYzM1MjJhYzI2YjRhZmFhYTNmNmU3MmY5Y2JlZGQx">She walked back up to him and the Guildmaster. “What?” she asked.</p>
<p class="cnNiMzZkNjZlMTQ0NTQyNTZiMjY1Njc4ZTcxNjljMjJk">The Guard Captain’s expression was slightly strained as he smiled at her, and Vivi forced herself to relax.</p>
<p class="cnMxNTZkZmY3MzNjNzRiMThhMzkzMTI0NDhjZjYxZDhi">“And thank you for your help, Guard Captain.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNzM0MDZkNTBkNTQzZjc5Nzc3MWI2NjViMjEzYzdl">His tension eased. “Of course, Lady Adventurer. The least I could do in reciprocation for your valiant deeds.”</p>
<p class="cnNjOTgzYmI3ZTgyNTQyMGY5NThhNzY3YzY0MGRhN2My">She kept a straight face and didn’t respond. The formal talk was—amusing. But probably expected from high stations in this world.</p>
<p class="cnM3NDA4MWZlNGZkNjQwZjhiNTljN2ExMTBiYzIyMTdi">He cleared his throat. “We’ve determined the identities of the two individuals,” the Guard Captain said. “Meredith Hayes and Bennet Fisher.” He paused as if waiting for Vivi’s reaction, seeming equal parts disappointed and intrigued when her face didn’t so much as twitch. “Evaluated both at mithril, and long-standing criminals with significant bounties. Members of Morningstar. The Kingdoms have been looking for them for a while.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNmU1MjViNmQ1MjRmMTJhZWJhNTVmOGY0MWIzMDIz">Interesting. She didn’t know what Morningstar was, and considered asking. But decided against it. For her own peace of mind, she didn’t want to know what would have happened if she hadn’t come to help Saffra and Allen.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZWFjNzNkNDdjODRkZjliZDkzNTE3MDEyM2Y2Njgw">“Meaning we might struggle to contain them,” the Guard Captain added, maybe expecting her to have understood that implication.</p>
<p class="cnNmNWE2NmIxZmU3ODRmMmM5ZTMzOTkwZjkyZmJjNmUz">She stiffened. “What? Why?”</p>
<p class="cnMyNTRhYzhiODMxYjQzNzE5NmE1Y2UxYTJlM2M5MDBi">“Why?” He raised his eyebrows, but smoothed his face out shortly. “We have dedicated cells for troublesome individuals, certainly, but mithril-ranks, much less these two, are…”</p>
<p class="cnM3YzJmMzE0NjJhNzQzMmM5NGU1NjM1YzhmOTBjMDFm">“Wiley,” the Guildmaster supplied, his gruff voice interjecting for the first time.</p>
<p class="cnM2YTAxZGQ2NTE3MzQ2MjI4MjI5ZGFhZDU3MmZkY2M0">“Wiley. Indeed. One can never know what a mithril-rank might have in reserve.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ODFmNWU1MDE1YzQ1NDI4YWRlNTljNzA0M2E2M2U0">A cold feeling filled Vivi. If the incompetent city officials had let those two get away—</p>
<p class="cnNmNmFiZDcxZDhlODQ5ZDQ4ZmQ5ZTc1Nzk0ZmE4ZDFj">“Come,” Vivi demanded, grabbing the Guard Captain’s arm.</p>
<p class="cnM3NDBjNTEzNDVhNzQwODhhYTA5OTUxYTYwOTA3ZjI3">A [Far Sight] spell and a few [Blinks] later, they appeared outside the watchtower built into the city’s perimeter. “Go. Lead,” she ordered, her attempts at an amenable temperament from earlier disappearing.</p>
<p class="cnM0MjNhZWY0MmYyOTQ0MmRhMzMyMzYzZDQ1OGJhZjE1">The Captain was quick to adapt, if nothing else. He oriented faster than Vivi would have at the sudden teleportation.</p>
<p class="cnNkMmZkMmZmN2Y3ZDQyOTNiNDIzNjU2YTIwYzY3NTM2">He led her to the holding cells where the two prisoners were being kept.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTJlOTc1YzRiYjRmYTBhMDk1YjMxM2RkYTI5ZDA4">The reason she’d panicked was because she thought they might have somehow escaped, even in the limited time she’d been gone. But no; they were there. Both sitting on the stone floor, leaning against the wall, expressions darkening when their eyes met hers.</p>
<p class="cnNhNTc5NzNkOTRjODQyYWE4MDAzMDA2YzhlNDg1NWIz">Vivi ignored them and inspected the cells. She felt magic radiating from their shackles and the metal bars. The enchantments layered into the cells were far from insignificant.</p>
<p class="cnM0OGYxY2ZjMjg1NzQzN2E5MzU3Y2FlZDhlMjIyY2M1">She had acted rashly. The local watch had things in hand. She doubted these two could escape.</p>
<p class="cnM3YmRkNTZhNGQyNDRjYjVhZjg3MGRkYjMwZWI1Mzk1">But the Guard Captain had broached the possibility, so she raised her staff and cast:</p>
<p class="cnMyZWQwMWU5MTQ1NDQ2MzRiNjg0NzVhNDA2ZjVmNTJl">“[Martial Bind].”</p>
<p class="cnMxN2RjMTZmODlhYTRkOWVhYjEyY2U3OTY0MWFhYTFj">“[Aether Sink].”</p>
<p class="cnMzN2RhZDU3OTA5ZjRlNTBiYjg5M2M3YTUzNTBjODFl">“[Fetters of Reflex].”</p>
<p class="cnMwNjEyNzRiMThlYzRiNDFhY2M2N2NlMGM0ODRkYjY0">Three high-level spells that drastically reduced all of their key stats. It wasn’t a universal solution. The Guard Captain’s point had been that when it came to adventurers of sufficient level, keeping them in place could be dicey in the best of cases. Because who knew what skill or item they might have in reserve?</p>
<p class="cnMyNTBlYTZlMTU0OTQxYTlhYzMxOWM0Njk5ZDI3MDNi">Drastically reducing their stats was a good starting point though.</p>
<p class="cnM4YWQ5ZDllMmZkODQxZjZiOTdlMDlkMjM1MzY3OGUw">To be safe, Vivi also renewed her spatial tracking spell on each. That, at least, wouldn’t be removed. If they did flee, she would hunt them down herself. And maybe not let them live, this time.</p>
<p class="cnNmNTAxYjdkYmYwMjQ0OWFhYmYwZTU4ZWNiNzE4YzY3">She swatted that idea away. She wouldn’t become some vigilante killer. That was a dangerous slope to start sliding down as some random girl suddenly given immense power.</p>
<p class="cnM0YjVhMDg4N2MwMDQzZGJhNWYzNWM3Y2VlOTBlN2Jh">“Those spells will last a day. Anyone could fight them and win, now.” She waved a hand. “Decide what else you need to keep them secure, and if I can help, I will.”</p>
<p class="cnNiZWE0Yzg0MThjYjQzMTdhNjQxZDlmYzczM2ExYmFl">Her attention was briefly caught by the runes engraved around the prison cell. She traced one with her finger, surprised by how easily she recognized the meaning of each arcane symbol.</p>
<p class="cnNhOTNmNmZjNzg2YjQwYWM5OTFjODdiMGExN2Q2NTBh">“And these are nearly decayed. I know some enchanting. I’ll renew and improve them where I can.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMWIxMDA0NDFlMTQ2NjFhYjQ5Nzc0ZmEzZDQ1ZTRk">She had no intentions of letting these two get away.</p>

## Chapter 10: 10 - Guard Captain


                <p class="cnMwNjk2YTBjNTcwMTQwZjhhMGExMmY1NWU4ODQ3MTQw">After everything had been taken care of, the Guard Captain turned to her and said, “While I appreciate the help, Lady Adventurer, I must protest your breach of etiquette earlier.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MzQ3NDNlNTY1MTQxM2ZiMDgwNzNjYmI3ZGM5ZTQ2">Vivi blinked at him. His cool gray eyes met hers, and they were less yielding than usual.</p>
<p class="cnNjMDUzMWZhN2NjNzRiMmY4NmZlMzJmMjMyMTcxYmFi">“By that I mean your magical assault on my person,” he clarified. “One cannot go around seizing and teleporting city officials. It could easily be misconstrued as an attack. Thankfully, the guardsman accompanying me is a more discerning sort, but had it been another, we might have found ourselves in an…unfortunate situation.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMTE5ODIxYzQ3ODRkY2VhZWM5MjE1YjQ1ZDA1ZmE0">Internally, Vivi felt herself flush. She had already suspected that she was breaking decorum with how casually she spoke to this man, but he was right: that, especially, had been going too far. Teleporting people without their permission was likely defined as ‘magical assault’ by whatever their legal system was.</p>
<p class="cnNjMGFkNTg0NDg0NDQ3ZmQ4ZGM4MDE1NGZjOWVjYzBm">“My apologies.” That her voice remained steady pleased her. She wouldn’t have managed it in her old body. “Your words concerned me, so I rushed to ensure the two prisoners were secure.”</p>
<p class="cnMzZjY4YmQ3OGJiOTQyYmM5ZmYwMDllODVkYmRmMjI4">“I intuited as much. Nevertheless, I request more discretion in the future.” When Vivi nodded, he did so as well, amiably moving past the bit of awkwardness. “Now, if you please? We have business remaining with Guildmaster Flint.” He extended a gloved hand.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTY3Y2NkNTI5YTRlZDRhZjJhMWM3Zjg5NmFiYzAx">Vivi laid her own atop it, then used the [Farsight] and [Blink] combination to arrive at her desired location—the alleyway to the right of the Guild.</p>
<p class="cnM5Y2E0NzAzYWRjMDQ2Yjg5YjMzMTEzZTExOTZhMWVl">“Tier nine magic, no?” Guard Captain Soren asked with apparent casualness. But even Vivi could tell it was feigned. She chose not to respond.</p>
<p class="cnMxNmUwZTJlNTQ0ODRjNzliZTkzYmZlNWM5MDQzN2Vj">They walked into the Guild and met with the Guildmaster, who was trying to calm an agitated-looking guardsman. No doubt agitated because his superior had been kidnapped. Vivi internally flushed a second time at the reminder.</p>
<p class="cnNkNjdjZTI3ZmE2OTQwMzJhYmRjMzRmMmJlNmIyYjQw">Various other adventurers watched them as they walked in, some subtly, and some not so much. Vivi supposed she’d blown her cover to the whole guildhall, teleporting the Guard Captain away. She had really acted rashly.</p>
<p class="cnM2ODhjNWZkZGIxZjQ2OTI5Y2IzZjhiMThiYjZmN2Y1">“No need for concern,” the Guard Captain told his subordinate. “The lady of the hour was simply enthusiastic to ensure our defenses. She’s kindly offered to renew and improve the cell’s enchantments as well, though we’re waiting on a supply requisition.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MDIzOWRmZDY2NjQxNWFhZDMzNGMyZjUxYTdhMTAz">The guard eyed Vivi, but bowed toward the Guard Captain, who gave his own nod in response.</p>
<p class="cnNkOGZmZWM5MmJlYjQ0Y2Y5MDhlZTRiMDZhNzZjZDg3">“Now, I admit requesting your help was one of the reasons I came seeking you, Lady Adventurer,” the Guard Captain said. “Magical experts are one of the more reliable methods for detaining criminals, and it isn’t every day mithril-ranks need to be locked away on such short notice. To be frank, on-the-spot execution is usually where these cases start and end. Securing mithril-ranks is simply too dangerous for everyone involved. That said, two living members of Morningstar is no small boon. Perhaps we’ll finally find an opening into this organization. Interrogators and proper guards will be here shortly.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMTVmZWNiNmIxYTQ3ZThiNzg2ODI1ZGRkZGEwN2Fj">Execution was the default approach? That was brutal, but after considering the situation, she couldn’t call it undeserved. She couldn’t use Earth logic here. Criminals in her world couldn’t teleport out of their cells or use another of a million skills, items, or spells to complicate their detainment. Killing really might be the appropriate first step when it came to dangerous rogue elements.</p>
<p class="cnNhMmZmYzYzNzViNTQ1ZmU4OGU1NTQ0NGJiZDU0MTcx">As for what ‘interrogators’ meant…she didn’t think too hard on it. She had already had one wake-up call that being dropped in a fantasy world didn’t mean frolicking around in fields of flowers. She <em>hoped </em>the so-called good guys wouldn’t resort to torture, but that happened even in her supposedly more humane world.</p>
<p class="cnMxNzZjNjQ4YmEzYTQ5NjI5OWU0NWQ5YzA2NzFjMmE0">“In any case,” the Guard Captain said, clapping. “That fulfills one of two goals! Now, the bounty. There was a rather significant one. Forty mithril apiece.”</p>
<p class="cnMyZjllNGE1M2UyODRjOWU5NDQyOGUxYzJlYmU3NmE2">Vivi felt her eyebrows raise. Not <em>that </em>significant, seeing how an hour of work had made a little over thirty, earlier.</p>
<p class="cnNmODk2YzU5YmM4NDQ0MjY5YjQxMDdlOWYyMTZiYjQ3">She reminded herself that most people couldn’t teleport around and instantly kill orichalcum-tier monsters. Even if she’d initially thought the Frostmaw Titans were merely ‘upper-middle tier’. She had put together by now that her sense of scale was off. Probably because in context, Vivisari was a figure of myth. Frostmaw Titans had been decent hunting targets in the mid-game for <em>her</em>, which meant beyond end-game for regular people.</p>
<p class="cnM3YzNkZDAyNzZmMDQ1MzJiOWE5M2JjYjY1MGZiMGVk">She didn’t react to the announcement of the impressive sum, and the Guildmaster seemed mildly amused. He had been the one to hand off the payment for her loot haul earlier, so he knew that eighty mithril, while impressive to most adventurers, even higher tier ones, likely wasn’t much to her.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzNmZDM5YTU0ZTQxMjY5MWQ2ZDlkNzdhYzgzZmVk">“I see. You have it now?”</p><span class="cjZhZjk1ODQ3OGRhZTQ0NDBhZGM4NzAzMTE3Y2YyYjcy"><br>Love this novel? Read it on Royal Road to ensure the author gets credit.<br></span>
<p class="cnNmMzVjZTM1OTE1ZTRjMDA4YmJkZGY4OWI4YWZmNDM2">“It’s being put together. Ready by morn at the latest. You’ll be staying for the first day of the festival, I hope?”</p>
<p class="cnM2YzI5MmQ0MmRmYzQzZGQ5YmZiYTQ1ZmZmMWFlNDA1">Vivi nodded. But only the first. She had business in Meridian.</p>
<p class="cnMyNGI1OGQxMmYzMzRkMjNiODQxYTViODc2ZWZkYzEw">“Then the last matter is that of credit,” Guard Captain Soren said. “Such a meritorious act would provide significant advancement toward qualification for rank, but my conversation with the Guildmaster indicates you’re new to the City. Ah, I misspoke. You visited around a century ago?” The sentence which sounded strange to Vivi’s ears didn’t make the man himself pause. More than one long-lived race populated this world, and they weren’t rare. “More relevantly, you haven’t registered with the Guild.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMDhiNzM2YjkwMjQ4MDVhYjAxZjIyOGI4OWM2Mzhm">“I have not.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NmM0MThmZTc2MTQ0YThiNjY4NTMxZTg5YTdlYThj">“Then I’d like to extend an offer. Feel free to refuse, naturally, but one good turn deserves another. I’ve spoken with the Guildmaster”—the short, strongly-built man nodded when the Guard Captain gestured at him—“and he’s authorized a gold-rank registration. Of course, that your skill far eclipses gold is without question, but even this is unconventional, deserved or not. Consider it a sign of our thanks, to accelerate some of the bureaucratic necessities, should you be interested in fostering a relationship with the Adventurer’s Guild.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NmQ2YWZhYWZhZDQ5ZDA5ZTBkODZmYmQ3OGQ5ZWRk">Hm. She didn’t intend on climbing through the ranks of the Adventurer’s Guild—why would she?—but assuming she wanted to keep an alternate identity, a quick jump to gold would be convenient.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTA3NWMzYzI3MTQ1MWU5OGFiNWJhMGM2OThhMTU3">And she did want to keep a backup identity. Openly announcing herself as Vivisari Vexaria everywhere she went came with all sorts of troubles. Even when she eventually felt comfortable with the world and no longer wanted to hide who she was explicitly, having a fallback to avoid the scrutiny that came with being a figure of legend would be nice.</p>
<p class="cnMyOWY2MTVkOTA0MTQxMWU5MDZiOTQ5MjdmMDA1MmMw">“The gesture is appreciated,” she said.</p>
<p class="cnM0YjlmODc5NzQwMTQwMzZiYmY5N2M3Zjg2OWQ5ODE4">He smiled and nodded. She was struck by how good-natured the Captain of the Guard seemed. Her thoughts went, again, to Lailah. That experience had soured how quickly she would trust.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzQ3N2QwYTdjNzQzZThiYjE0YTAyNjIwN2RkMWUz">“Glad to hear, Lady Adventurer. I’ll be taking my leave then. My plate is beyond overfull. The Festival alone is enough to cause a Captain of the Guard a headache to last a month, much less all of this business. Do you need anything else of me?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYzE1ZDFhOGU4ZjRjZTM4ODU1MzJkYjFjNTc4YmE2">She shook her head.</p>
<p class="cnMzMTQ1MTE1OGMwZjQ4YTE5ODg1NDhlNWJiYmEwNTY2">“Then let me offer my thanks once more,” he said, bowing deeply at the waist.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZmZkNzJiOTVhYjQ0Y2Y4M2FjNjM4OWM5YzQyNzY2">She returned it, somewhat hesitantly, and since he didn’t seem to find that odd, she guessed she’d done the right thing.</p>
<p class="cnNhODQ3ZDdlOGY2NDQ0NWZiMGM1MGI0Y2IzZDE0MGFj">He strode out, his guardsman falling in step behind him.</p>
<p class="cnM0OGQ1ZGJjZTdhNjRhYTJhYzMyMzI0N2EwZDZhY2Ux">Guildmaster Dougal Flint faced her next. His expression was considering, and he crossed his arms as he mulled over what to say.</p>
<p class="cnNlZDUxNWIyZDhmNDRhOTNiMzhlNzI5MzBiZmUyNWNh">“Same goes for me, for the record, but not for the Morningstars. Shoving those two in a dark hole will be good for humanity, don’t get me wrong, but that’s not what I’m grateful for.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNDMyNzM2YmE1NTRlNDg4ZjczMTg2ZjhjMjcxZDBm">Vivi tilted her head, interested.</p>
<p class="cnNkMzExMDI1MWFlMDQyZDNiOGU0ZTU3ZTFiMDYyM2U1">“You’ve seen it yourself, I think. That girl, Saffra, she’s one of the good ones. Been watching her since she came in a few months ago, she had that look that said she might need help. Did fine though, never had to step in. Allen too. He’s a good one. The temple will have their own thanks to give for helping one of their own.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NGUzNWVmZDI5YjRmMTc4MWY2MGRlOTdmMzM4YWNm">Dougal Flint rubbed his chin as he considered his words, seeming frustrated.</p>
<p class="cnNmYzYxMTQ5MmI0MjQ4YmFiN2NlYzNmZTc1YWYyYTc5">“Look,” he said. “I became Guildmaster for a reason. Most people working as adventurers, not everything’s going perfectly for them. There are easier, more comfortable ways to make a living. I could’a settled down you know, I’m no pushover, most Guildmasters in the cities aren’t. We did our time, made our small fortunes almost dying. No. I became Guildmaster because I wanted to look over the folk who needed lookin’ over. I failed this time. Don’t know how I let those monsters walk around without noticing.”</p>
<p class="cnNlODg5N2QyN2E2MzQ3MTlhZmVjMjJmMTEzMzU5MDYw">His expression was deadly serious as he squarely met her eyes.</p>
<p class="cnNhNDhmMTU3MTExMzQxZGQ5N2IxNWViNDM4YWY4YmRj">“You stepped in where I couldn’t. That’s how community ought to work, but it still stings a little, if I’m being pure honest. You ever need something, come ask. I’ll do what I can and then some.”</p>
<p class="cnNlODM4ODg1YmVlZTQzMDM5NWNlMzgwNmY0YzQxMzNh">Vivi wasn’t sure how to meet such sincerity. Especially when she was still blaming herself for how poorly things had gone. She didn’t deserve to be thanked like this. She disappointed herself when her only response was a nod.</p>
<p class="cnM2M2M4MmM1YWEzOTQwYjA5ZTQyOWY5ZTQ2OTZmOTY2">The Guildmaster didn’t seem to mind. “Alright, then. Let’s get you registered.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNmNjMjExNjk5OTQxNDViZDNjZTM2ZmZmZGI5NzNm">Twenty minutes later, she had a card identifying herself and a badge marking her as a gold-rank adventurer. She used the name ‘Vivienne’ instead of ‘Vivi’. It seemed smart to separate herself from Vivisari, no matter how trivially.</p>
<p class="cnM5YTYyNWFiNDM5NTQyNWFiYmY1ZDFjZmM2M2Y2ZTc2">The metal badge was engraved with a symbol of a staff, marking her as a generalist mage. There were a number of symbols to choose from, though most people requested one of the major five.</p>
<p class="cnNjYjg1MGE5YWQwYzQ1YmQ4NDkzNTFlYjdhYTIxZGFk">Soon enough, Vivi extricated herself from the clutches of the Guildmaster, not that he’d been trying to keep her around.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzA5OTlhYmNlZTQwNGE4YjAwZWRiZWU1NmQwOGFm">Finally free, she went through her usual routine: alleyway, [Invisibility], [Fly], [Blink].</p>
<p class="cnNmOGM1MmEzNTQxZDRjMGJhN2I1Y2Y3YWQwZDI1OWE2">Her conversation with the Guildmaster churned inside her head. Particularly the part about Saffra. She’d seen the girl stalking out of the guild earlier and had decided to leave her alone. Saffra probably wanted to go through life and forget the events of today had ever happened.</p>
<p class="cnM3YWU2ZWMzODVjNzRhYWFhZjZmODEwYTIyMTE4NjI3">Vivi would encourage that. But even the Guildmaster had mentioned how the girl seemed to be ‘one of the good ones’. From what Vivi had seen, she was inclined to agree. Saffra had only joined Lailah because Allen had; she had wanted to look out for him. That had been made clear in the accounts of the events the guards had extracted. And despite that pure motive, things had nearly turned out in the worst way for her.</p>
<p class="cnNmMDdlNzc0MTg4OTQ4YWFiNDMzNjNlMjY2OTExYzhm">The girl was clearly shaken. She’d plastered on a mask of bluster, trying to come off like she’d moved past it already, but even Vivi had seen through the act.</p>
<p class="cnNjODI0MTk4NTAwNzQ0YjFhZTg1YWRjOGQ1NWQyNDY0">Then the catgirl had run off at first opportunity to return to her previous quest: that missing pet poster.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjQxY2Y5YWVjOTRjMmM4MjY5NmI0NmJlY2FiMmRm">She could imagine how that task of hers had manifested. A teary-eyed kid asking for help from the silver-badge adventurer as she was out and about her daily life—the teenage girl more approachable than the others. And Saffra hadn’t been able to deny her.</p>
<p class="cnM5N2I4NjYzZTE5NjQzNzc4ZTFjODQwYTFjODA5YzY4">Maybe that was all fantasy, but it didn’t seem out of place for what she knew of the girl.</p>
<p class="cnNkOGVjZmFhMjAzYTQxOGFhZmQ4MmI4ZDljZGJjNWRh">Vivi summoned the poster from her inventory and scanned it.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDVmNTk4N2M0NTRkZThhYzMxNDQ1MmExNGIwNjNi">If there was something she could do to make the actual<em> </em>hero of this dreadful debacle feel better, she would do it. She would locate this missing pet and somehow orchestrate events so that Saffra tracked it down and assumed all credit. She deserved a win.</p>
<p class="cnNhOTE0MmI0ZDkxMTRlZjRhMGU0ZDlhNjhiYmM3MGVl">With these grand and mystical powers Vivi had been given, she had a cat to find.</p>

## Chapter 11: 11 - Missing Cat


                <p class="cnMzYzExMmExNDA2YjQyNzBiYjgwNDQxMTlkODViOGMz">Vivi had fallen in love with Seven Cataclysms in part because of the spell diversity. The developers had tried to make magic feel real, a part of the world. The arsenal available to a high-level mage wasn’t just fireballs and bolts of lightning—though, the show-stopping offensive spells might have sold her on the game alone.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjAzZTk5YjA1YjQxNTdiZGI1YzZhZjNiZjEzNDhk">No, a mage had access to deeper and wider magic than that. As seen by her buffs and debuffs, invisibility, spatial warps, and even that tracking spell. All had been usable in the game, and often helpful in quests and combat.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjMzNDk0MjM3NDRmYThiYjVlNjk5ZDBjZTY5NjZm">There was even divination magic. The classic abilities, of course: [Detect Presence], [Detect Magic], [Detect Poison], and so on. But more interesting ones too: [Identify], for example, which described items more comprehensively than the built-in [Inspect], and [Farsight], which she’d made heavy use of.</p>
<p class="cnNiMDdkYzQwNDJmMDQyN2Y5NjBlOTc0NzU2ZDc0MDk4">For the most part, they were utility-based spells. Not a comprehensive branch of magic, and probably the one she was weakest in, since, speaking from a reasonable meta perspective, developers could hardly implement ‘reading the future’.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjI5YjcyYmE4ZDRlMGRhNjVjN2MwMWRlZTBjMDY2">Scrolling through the filtered list of spells, she found what she wanted nestled between [Locate Person] and [Locate Object].</p>
<p class="cnNlOGY4Zjk5YjdhMTQ4MzBhMjUyMDg5YjUzNDYzNTE3">[Locate Creature].</p>
<p class="cnNkM2MwOTY0ZDAyYzQ1YTE5YmU5NGZkM2ViZTBmZjMy">Unfortunately, the spell required something to anchor off. An article of clothing for a missing person, perhaps. For a pet: hair, a collar, something like that. While she was a powerful mage, she wasn’t omnipotent. She couldn’t will the location of the missing cat into existence with nothing to go off of.</p>
<p class="cnMxMTNmMjk3NDYwNzRmMjM4NzU2MTQ4Nzk3ZmVjZTQw">Studying the instructions for how to cast the spell, noting the suggested spell circle, she nodded to herself and dispelled the skill screen. Opening her inventory, she tapped the icon to summon the poster again.</p>
<p class="cnM2NzA5ZTBhYWRlYjQxMzQ4Y2U5MzliOWJmYjk5NWU4">She didn’t actually have to touch items to bring them out of inventory, but muscle memory was hard to shake. Seven Cataclysms hadn’t hooked into the brain so deeply it could read a person’s thoughts, which meant physical gestures were necessary for interacting with the game system, but this system <em>did </em>read people’s minds. Mental commands were often enough to perform a given task.</p>
<p class="cnNlMWJmMWFmMjNiYjQ0OTBiYjUzNDgzZDY1NDIyNzNm">Which weirded her out when she thought about it, that something was reading her mind to fulfill her silent requests, but she piled it atop the growing mountain of strangeness.</p>
<p class="cnNmY2Y0ZGJjZDNhYTQ4MjVhN2U3N2Y4YjhkODViYjYz">With poster in hand, she scanned the drawing of a dapper gentleman of a cat. The paper announced him as Monocle, the name no doubt inspired by the distinctive black fur eye patch. A reward stood out in bold at the bottom: a full gold piece. She had a skewed sense of money, surely, but she expected that was quite a lot for a missing animal.</p>
<p class="cnM4OTNjNDdkNmRlYzQxYWRhNDY1Nzc3N2UxY2RlZGU5">She didn’t have a great grasp on how technologically advanced this world was, and she doubted she could rely on her tentative understanding of Earth’s development as a parallel when magic suffused the world so thoroughly anyway, but she didn’t think paper would be the cheapest thing to procure in large quantities in this time period. Creating posters to hang and pass around wasn’t something a commoner would normally bother with, she figured.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjlmYTQ4MjAyZTRlMjFhODhjMTEyNjgxZTRkOGM1">Thus, it didn’t surprise her when her quest took her to a wealthy-looking three-story manor in one of the better parts of Prismarche. Having flown over the city a few times, she knew where the noble’s district was, and this was decidedly not that. A well-to-do merchant, perhaps, but not a family drowning in gold.</p>
<p class="cnNlM2MwY2QyOGU0MTRhY2ZiNjEwZjIxMjRiODU2MWI3">A servant fielded Vivi when she arrived at the door: a young woman in a maid’s outfit. She secretly admired the uniform, since, aesthetically speaking, she had always loved maids and butlers. Her own assistant—personal assistants were an integrated feature of Seven Cataclysms—had been a butler.</p>
<p class="cnM3NTRlMzkwODZkNzRmNmRiOWU3OWY4YzVhZmRiMTVl">Winston. She wondered whether he was alive. It had been a hundred years. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume natural causes had claimed him. Then again, levels seemed to prolong lifespans. He might still be alive.</p>
<p class="cnMwMjZiN2ExOGMxOTQyMWI5YzI3ZDQxYzRkZTlhYzlh">After explaining why she’d come, the maid escorted Vivi to the sitting room. Ten minutes later, she met with the person responsible for the save-Monocle campaign. Vivi’s earlier guess had been right: it was a young girl, around nine or ten, with brown hair and brown eyes. She looked hopeful as she walked into the room, earnestly blurting out, “You know divination magic?”</p>
<p class="cnMyOTVjMWFjOTE4ZjRhN2RiYjE2MjUyNGI5MTRlNzRj">“I do,” Vivi said, standing to meet her. “But I’ll need something of his. His brush, if you have one. A toy. Hair would suffice but wouldn’t be ideal. The more conceptually linked the item is, the better the results.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZWY1NTQ0ZmJhYjRiNjk5YTRmYTAzNGEyZjhiZDM4">“Wow,” Daisy breathed.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZmRmYzQyMzI0ZDRlY2FiZWQ2MGUzNmYyNTQ3ODY2">“Divination magic is unreliable in the best of circumstances, Miss Daisy,” the maid said, obviously trying to moderate the young lady’s expectations for her own sake. “Not that the help isn’t deeply appreciated,” she added gracefully, giving a curtsy toward Vivi.</p>
<p class="cnMyMzZlNzE5NmNjZTRhMjZhNTYwMWRmMjQ1YjEyYWVj">“Are you from the Institute?” Daisy asked.</p>
<p class="cnNmYmVmYjUzM2E1MzRlZjA5YjYzMzQ3YWJiMzI4YzYz">The Institute?</p>
<p class="cnMxY2FjNzAyMTM2MDRiNzFiZDFlZTM3MjI3ZDgwNmZh">Vivi wracked her brain. The Institute. The Thaumaturgical Institute? It hadn’t been the most crucial organization of Seven Cataclysms, but it had been featured somewhat prominently. Especially as a mage. It had been the background location for a number of Class Quests.</p>
<p class="cnM1MzVmMzc5ODgxZTQ4MDlhZDEwNmQ3NjE5MWE3YTQ0">Lore-wise, the academy served as a place of learning for mages of all varieties—besides those who drew their power from the divine, like priests. But all others, such as mages, druids, conjurers, necromancers, and so on, attended the Institute. She’d been there many times, and had a strong mental image of the looming tower of white stone, with all its winding staircases, classrooms, and multi-storied libraries within.</p>
<p class="cnNjNzc3OTFiNWQ3ZjRkZDE4OWY4NTEyYzk1MTk4ZTRh">“I’ve visited,” Vivi said. “But I’m not a graduate, or officially associated.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNDBlMTgwNjk2YzRhMjhhYWNjNzVlYjBkYjAwODli">Daisy seemed disappointed, but surprisingly for a nine-year-old, she had the grace to wipe the look away. Vivi wasn’t so socially daft she couldn’t read a child’s expression. Apparently, an Institute education represented a badge of merit for mages in this world, and not<em> </em>having one, the opposite.</p><span class="cmU1ZmRlYmVhY2ExNzRmNmY4ZTVhZjE4NmVhNTlhNzJi"><br>The tale has been illicitly lifted; should you spot it on Amazon, report the violation.<br></span>
<p class="cnNjOGE5Yjc4N2UxMzQyZjBiMzI3MmMxNDU3MDg3ZDli">“Um,” Daisy said, remembering the thread of conversation. “A brush or toy? We didn’t brush him much.” She glanced at the maid, who nodded in confirmation. “There was a ball of yarn he liked though? He played with it every day.<em> </em>I could go find it.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNGMwM2NiNjM2ZDQyYWRhMzUzOWVmYTRhMDM5OTZk">“That would suffice.”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZmQ1ODczZTBmYzQ5ODNiYTU1N2E1NzYyMmIxYWZj">Vivi idled in the waiting room for a handful of minutes before Daisy and the maid returned with the ball of pale blue yarn in question. The thing was a shredded mess. Good. It seemed like a well-used toy of Monocle’s, an item that had become closely associated with him over the years.</p>
<p class="cnNjZjFmMDFmMmNiYTQ4NjhiNDIwZThjNjUyYzFhYzNi">“This will help?” Daisy asked hopefully.</p>
<p class="cnM0MjYzNGFhODhlODRhZDZiZmU5MjkzMmI2OTNiOGMw">“Perhaps,” Vivi said, already wincing at how she would need to fake a failure. Because she was here to help Saffra. The spell would almost certainly work, but she would have to claim that it hadn’t. She was orchestrating a sinister scheme: Saffra would be the hero of the day, not her.</p>
<p class="cnNmNzIxZjRiNDJhNDQwODdhMjBjMjI5NzJiYmZjZDE0">She took the ball of yarn and set it on a side table. Her staff appeared with a pop of displaced air. She lowered the length of wood toward the item and began to cast.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZTE2MTdlMTc2MjQ2MmNhZGNhOTFkODE0Y2VhZGIw">She considered whether to repress the vocal command and hide the spell circle, but ultimately saw no reason to. The glowing arcane diagram appeared in the air as she slowly pulled together the spell. Very<em> </em>slowly. Trying to seem less competent than she was, so Daisy wouldn’t be surprised when she failed.</p>
<p class="cnNlMmUyNmQ3N2MxMjQ4NTRhZWE2ODNhNzc4ZWZlNWE5">The maid pulled a starry-eyed Daisy away, and Vivi glanced toward them, mildly offended at the implication that she might hurt someone with wayward magic. But she guessed she couldn’t blame the maid for being protective.</p>
<p class="cnNjNmFlYzQyYWE5YzQ4ZTA4ZjZjZWQzM2ZjOTBhZDFk">“[Locate Creature].”</p>
<p class="cnNlOWJkYTY3YTg2OTQ2NzI5MmQyOWFiMzllYmUxODc1">There had been a chance the cat was dead. It might have escaped somehow, yes, but it also might have met some grisly fate that had been covered up by the parents or another party, since the young lady of the house clearly cherished the animal.</p>
<p class="cnM3N2NhZTc3NGQ5MzQzY2U4YTA0MjYxMGYyMTRiYzM3">She repressed a sigh of relief when images filled her head, and she confirmed Monocle was definitely alive.</p>
<p class="cnM3NmQ2ZGEwNzMxZjQ2NGJiMWMwMDE2MTM3OTIxOTU0">As she had discovered earlier, even basic spells tended to be amplified when cast by her, no doubt thanks to the outrageous multi-million points she had in the two primary magic stats. She could adjust the strength mentally if she focused, but in this instance she hadn’t. Divination magic was finicky, and she had wanted the best information she could get.</p>
<p class="cnNkODYxOTMxMDVkZjQ1MTJhM2M3MWVkMWY5OWUxZWRl">The mythical Sorceress who had purged the world of seven earth-rending Cataclysms, it turned out, had more than enough magical strength to divine the location of a missing cat.</p>
<p class="cnMyM2ZhOTI1NWNlNDQ5NjZhYjY4YWJkMDA1YmRmNTJi">Images appeared in her head, snippets of Monocle jumping out an open window, being startled by some crashing noise out of vision, and bolting over the low garden wall. He disappeared into the hectic mass of the city.</p>
<p class="cnNjOGI4NzQ2NzNkNzQzN2JiOTllNzcwYzk5OWExZjBh">The visions settled on a rather bedraggled cat, not nearly as finely distinguished as in his poster, slouched in a dark alley somewhere. And not <em>somewhere—</em>a tickling in her brain had her eyes drifting in the direction automatically.</p>
<p class="cnM4Y2I5NTI0MmQ0MzQxMGQ4YTI3ZDU1NGYwNjgxMzk1">“Did it work?”</p>
<p class="cnNlN2I2OWY3NjhmOTQyN2U5ZGFmMGRmODRlYzE3ZjFk">Vivi braced herself for crushing the dreams sparkling in the eyes of a ten-year-old girl. “It did not. I’m not certain why. I apologize.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZGEwMGNiOGMxMDQ0MTZhM2YzMjE0M2I3N2M1NmMy">The poor girl deflated so badly it looked like she might start crying. “Is there anything else you can do?”</p>
<p class="cnNjYWY1ZWRjZTU0MTQzMzg4MDM5NjQ0Y2ZhZWQ1YTU2">Playing the villain, even if she wasn’t <em>actually</em> being a villain, was harder than she had thought it would be. Thankfully, the dismay didn’t reach her face. “I’m afraid not. I’ll keep an eye out, though.”</p>
<p class="cnM5ZjI4MDVmYmJiZDQ0ZTFiOThmYjVkZWFhM2YzMjRh">“I understand,” Daisy mumbled.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDEyZjhhZDkzMTQ1OTM5MDBiMGY5MzA0YTE4Njhi">Vivi extracted herself from the scenario, feeling like dirt even if Daisy would be reunited with her beloved cat in an hour or two.</p>
<p class="cnM4YjE4M2EyYjE3MDQwYjhiM2Y2ZTdjNGJiNmEyOWU1">Now the trickier part. Arranging Saffra’s rescue mission.</p>
<p class="cnNjOGM1NTlmZDEyMjRkZjNiZDRhNzc1OWY0NGZlZDI2">First, she wrapped herself in [Invisibility] the moment she escaped from potential curious eyes. Flying across the city, she followed the magical link pointing her to Monocle. Divination spells typically gave vague hints at best, but she had enough mana to raze a city. Monocle’s presence was a blazing beacon to her senses.</p>
<p class="cnMzOTM5Y2EwY2Q3MDQ3ZTY5ZDMwNWQwZDdlNzg1MzQ1">She found the cat slumped in that alleyway she’d seen at the end of the divination. She dispelled her invisibility and stepped cautiously toward him. Sensing her, Monocle sprang to his feet, hissing and spitting with an arched back.</p>
<p class="cnM1MjBkZDliZjkwNjRhZjVhODMzNjJjMDE0YTdmZmQy">She paused as she considered what to do. Just…kidnap him?</p>
<p class="cnMzZWMyYzgzYTlhYTQ5ZWY5OWFiMDVmNTc0MmRkZmRm">She hadn’t formulated a master plan. The extent was: find Monocle, get him in front of Saffra, and let her be hailed as Daisy’s hero. Seizing the poor creature with a [Telekinesis] spell felt rather mean though.</p>
<p class="cnM0OTRhMWJhZjg4YjQ3NjI5NDk5YTVjMmFhOGZkYmE1">She [Calmed] him first, and his panic at some stranger invading his alleyway eased into him settling on his haunches and seeming wary.</p>
<p class="cnM3Y2E2N2U0Njc3YTRlNjZiMDBlNzE0MTI2MTdlNjFk">Mentally, she checked on Saffra’s tracking spell. She wasn’t far, searching through the same wealthy section of the city Vivi had just come from. Not a bad idea, but somehow Monocle had ended up slinking around the slums. No wonder Saffra, or anyone else, was having little success finding him.</p>
<p class="cnNlYzBmZWI1YTlhYjRhOGI5NTcyZjU1YTI4NjY3NGQ1">“Guess I don’t have any choice,” she sighed. “Sorry for this, Monocle.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NWE4MzE4NjRlYjQyMjc4YmU5MzE5Y2Y4MDE0YTU5">Two [Invisibilities], [Flies], and a [Telekinesis] later, she was escorting her prisoner across the city. As expected, the cat found the whole process more than a little disturbing. She cast [Calm] as needed, though it was a bandaid solution.</p>
<p class="cnNjNDEyMzBhNzgzZjQxOWQ4Y2IzM2I5MThiZjlhN2Y0">“Oh, it’s for your own good, stop complaining,” she said, somewhat guiltily, to the flailing animal.</p>
<p class="cnM1NGZiYTM2ZDNiMDRmNzNhY2NlYWZiZGI3MzBhN2Q2">She flew until she found the red-haired catgirl prowling along, eyes swiveling left and right. She was stopping occasionally to show the missing cat poster to random passersby, who received her with varying levels of goodwill. Vivi almost set one of the rude ones on fire, but that would probably be an overreaction. She still considered it.</p>
<p class="cnNlM2NjNzA3MjRhYzRhZGQ5OTI3Njc5N2M3OWJhOGNl">The floating, invisible cat who was only being moderately assuaged by Vivi’s calming spells made it clear she needed to sort this situation out sooner than later. She set him down in the corner of a set of steps and layered one last [Calm] onto him before dispelling the invisibility and hovering away to see how the situation developed.</p>
<p class="cnM0ODcwMDg1ZjFmNjQyMzk4NGI5NDIyMThlYTI3Mjdi">Saffra’s vigilant posture wasn’t for show. Her swiveling head and keen eyes landed on Monocle the moment she turned the corner and found the—perhaps more disturbed than was logically appropriate for the situation—cat. She froze, referenced the paper in hand, and hesitated.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDg0ZTQ2ODc4ZjRkNTdhZmY0Y2E2MGM2MGRlZGIx">Vivi feared she would dismiss the creature as some other stray. The difference between the cat in the poster and the cat in reality wasn’t small. Monocle had had a tough few weeks.</p>
<p class="cnNmNzEwMjI5M2I2YTQ3ZDdiNzZiOTk2N2JjM2Q0MWY4">But she didn’t. Incredulity spread across her face. Monocle’s trademark black eye-patch likely dispelled her doubts. Or maybe she was hoping for a win, and seized it when it came.</p>
<p class="cnNhNWI3ZGYyNzNhZTQ3ZDdhN2QzNjJhMmRiYTgwNjdj">Appeasing and securing the cat made for an ordeal that Vivi watched with amusement.</p>
<p class="cnM3MjBjMTg2MzQ4ZDRkOWY4ZTJjYzQ0NzMwZTI3NDUw">Forty-five minutes later, Saffra had made her way across the city and arrived at Daisy’s house.</p>
<p class="cnNkNzgyNTYxNjlkZjQ2Nzk5ODgxNDA0MTNkMGZmNjk5">Daisy started howling the moment she laid eyes on the filthy cat, and surprisingly, he wasn’t put off by the loud noises and sobbing girl: Monocle was happy to be scooped up and pampered.</p>
<p class="cnM4NmMyZWY2MzcwYTQwYzFhYTFiYTA4NTE1NGNiZTdm">Daisy made such a ruckus the lady of the house came down and checked on her, seeming surprised but pleased her daughter had reunited with her pet, though wrinkled her nose and made a clear allusion toward the maid to get it cleaned up posthaste.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzhjOGU3MzhiZjQwMTc4OGYyMWIyZGRmOTQ4OTVl">Saffra all but glowed with happiness throughout, and even staunchly refused the reward of a full gold coin.</p>
<p class="cnM3YzEyNTg5MzhiODQ1YmZhYmRlODI4MjVlMDAwMjM5">It was when Vivi was basking in satisfaction at a plan well executed that everything went wrong.</p>
<p class="cnM4YTcyMzU3NDk5NjRmMmU4ZjQ1ODBmNmIxZGRlNDgx">Daisy, clearing the last of her tears away and still petting Monocle despite the maid’s tentative but increasingly desperate requests to have him bathed, asked Saffra, “Did the woman from earlier help?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZTFiMTJiMzM4ODQzNjg4OTEyMTg0NDhiYmJiYTAx">Saffra blinked, a cup of tea half-raised to her lips. “The woman?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZTczNjRhOWVkMTRiZDM5NTdkYmJkYWI3NDY1ZTVi">“The demon. With white hair. Vivi, I think she called herself?”</p>

## Chapter 12: 12 - Peace Day Celebrations


                <p class="cnMzYzk2YmM1MTEwZjQ3OTViODY1ZTZmYzFhNzhhMzBm">Saffra froze at Vivi’s name. Daisy, ten-year-old girl she was, continued obliviously.</p>
<p class="cnM5MjEzODI0N2JiNzQxNmRhNWUzMDczNGU3NWIxMzg4">“She cast a divination spell. Locate Creature? She said it didn’t work. Do you know her?”</p>
<p class="cnM4OTlhMDAyYjA3MjQ1OTFiZmNjNDMwMDM4OTMyNjEz">Saffra lowered her teacup onto her plate and set both gently on the table.</p>
<p class="cnM1NjIzZTc0MjIzZjRlN2I4OWE1Zjk0MGJhNjM1MTkw">“She did, did she?” she asked slowly.</p>
<p class="cnM5YTkwNWMwMGZlYzRlZjRiOGZlZDU0NzU3MjM5Mjgw">Daisy bobbed her head with total innocence, even as Vivi withered and died inside.</p>
<p class="cnM4OWJiYjFlZjEwYjRkOGM5MGU3NWMyMmYzODM0MWQz">Why would Daisy think they knew each other? Sure, the timing made for a mild coincidence, but only that. With the hefty reward Daisy’s family had posted for such a simple task, the household had probably been receiving constant visitors. Why bring her up?</p>
<p class="cnM3MGJkZmQ0MDI1MjQ5OTlhZDA0MDQ1ODRjN2QxNDY0">Everything had almost gone perfectly. Only children could bulldoze through good intentions like this.</p>
<p class="cnM0YTY5ZDRiNjNhMjRkZThiN2ZmOWI1NTI2Y2Y3NTEx">“The spell was really cool! I don’t get to see magic often, and hers seemed <em>really</em> strong,” the enthusiastic Daisy chirped, happily petting the exhausted-but-relieved Monocle. “I thought it would work,” she said, slumping inward at the memory. She perked up a second later. “But you found him! So you two don’t know each other?”</p>
<p class="cnNhYTE4NDkzNGViZDQwMjZhZDJiODYzNWU4NTMwNDQ5">“I’ve seen her at the Guild,” Saffra said, her face blank. “But no, not really.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMzA1N2U2MjFhMDQ4NmNiNjU3ODlhZDQxODlmMWZm">“Oh. She seemed…nice, at least.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNWRiMDg2MDdkOTQzNDc4ZjI4Y2FiYjI5YWVkNjA3">The delay lasted much too long, and even Saffra seemed amused by it.</p>
<p class="cnNhZjljZWFjNzU4OTQ3MGFhOTZjMmU1ZDEyMjg1ZWQ2">“I think she <em>is</em> nice,” Saffra said. “But…I found him hiding behind some steps. She couldn’t have…I don’t see how…” She shook her head. “Divination magic is unreliable, no matter who you are. It was just a coincidence.” She nodded to herself, seeming to make up her mind. “I guess she read the poster I gave her, and came to try to help.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NWVjYmNhODRiOTQzZTM5NWEwMzllNTllOTkyNDcy">“You’ve been passing those out?” Daisy exclaimed. Her face scrunched up, and she burst into tears again, hugging Saffra fiercely, which Saffra seemed to be half-embarrassed and half-secretly-pleased by.</p>
<p class="cnNiZmJlZDZiOTc3YTRlYzY4ZTc0M2ExOGI1YTY5YjUy">The maid watched the exchange fondly, though interjected at the next opportunity with another desperate request to get the filthy cat cleaned up.</p>
<hr>
<p class="cnM4MWU4NjE1M2ViMDRhNDk5YWZjMzgzODNlZDQyNWUy">After watching the interaction a little longer, Vivi realized it was kind of creepy magically spying in on other people. Now that her involvement in the situation had concluded, she departed.</p>
<p class="cnM1OGFiMmNjNDFlNzRhMWJiZDQ3MzIzNmZlYzE4NjMx">Overall, the mission was a success. She wasn’t sure how suspicious Saffra was, and would have preferred Daisy never brought her up, but Saffra hadn’t seemed to assume the truth. Thankfully Vivi had a solid alibi: maybe she really had stopped by just because of the poster. It wasn’t like Saffra’s first thought would be to think Vivi had orchestrated a rescue-mission-by-proxy.</p>
<p class="cnMzNzI1ZDMyNjJjNDQ4NTE4Yzk5ZjQ0MzBlOGI0MzFh">The only loose thread was that Saffra knew Vivi was a powerful mage, and a [Locate Creature] spell failing might be suspect. But, as Saffra herself had said, divination magic was the least reliable of all branches, and mages had specialties. It was far from a stretch that even a powerful mage might fail a divination.</p>
<p class="cnNiODIzZjdmZWFlYzRmYjdiMjYxNDc4YTI5NGY2YzA2">A clock tower chimed in the distance, and Vivi’s eyes turned its way. Five o’clock. Evening had arrived and the festivities below were ramping up, the streets packed as nearly every citizen started to mingle throughout the city.</p>
<p class="cnMyYmYyOWU1MTdmZTQyZjhiMmEzZTE2NjQ0NmQxOWRh">From high in the sky, she could see where the bulk of activity clustered. The market and the town square were busiest, with preparations underway in the park—they were building a stage of some sort. Probably for later in the celebrations? The centennial Peace Day festival would last for seven days rather than the usual single, which meant a whole list of events.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjRiNWIzZjRlMjQ1YjhhNjYwNDcyMjNhNjE2MWJh">Surprisingly, it had only been six hours since she’d arrived. It felt longer. A lot had happened.</p>
<p class="cnM0NWZlMjI0OTFhMzQyMThhNTc2Mjc4YzY3NzYxMTE1">She hadn’t intended to get involved with Prismarche. She had wanted to look around and get her bearings before heading for Meridian. Now, she had terrorized a bank teller, dragged two prominent criminals into custody, and drawn the attention of the Guard Captain and the Guildmaster.</p>
<p class="cnM2YjNmZGRjMmIxMzQ1MjI4YmNmNTJlYmJkMzkzNWQy">So much for keeping her head down. At least her true identity remained hidden. Only the bank teller had any idea she was Vivisari, and he had been thoroughly convinced to keep quiet on that fact.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzBmMDliMGQyODRkMjFhNmIwMjkzMGQ3MTdlNGU1">There was one more task she needed to handle before she could set down in the streets and walk through the city as a normal person again. A short errand later, she confirmed the train schedule, and that tickets could be bought as needed; she didn’t need to book in advance. Her only real goal was getting to Meridian, so she was pleased she had made real progress toward that, no matter how minor. She would board in the morning, after she collected the bounty and reinforced the cell enchantments.</p>
<p class="cnMzOGRhYmI3ODdiYTQ0NzhhNmZhYzA1NTgwODVmYzVh">Somehow, she knew staying in Prismarche would only further entangle her in local events. She had found trouble even when she’d been anonymous. Now that the Guard Captain and Guildmaster knew her face and had marked her as a person of interest, further debacles would ensue. She needed to flee. Get to Meridian and check on her house and guild. Helping Saffra and Allen had been worth her time, obviously, but she had goals to work toward.</p>
<p class="cnNiYTM5NTc0M2VmYjQ0Njk5YjA0MTkzYzM1OGRmNTFm">Prismarche’s Peace Day celebrations were apparently something to behold, though, and they were going all out for the one-hundred-year anniversary. Vivi didn’t consider herself a ‘party girl’, but she wondered what lay in store. The next train didn’t board until noon tomorrow anyway. She wasn’t frivolously wasting time, besides in how she could maybe [Blink] her way to Meridian if she absolutely needed to—but she didn’t.</p><span class="cmU1YjMzYThhYzhmODQxNWQ4NTkwZTNmZGYwYjM1ODc1"><br>The author's tale has been misappropriated; report any instances of this story on Amazon.<br></span>
<p class="cnMxYzA1MzM3YjliZjRjY2RhYzhjZTJkNTk2MzJlMTRj">She wanted to experience this world and what it offered. There was no rush.</p>
<hr>
<p class="cnM2OWM1YjBkZDI4ZDQxM2RiMGMzM2VjMmMwOGFkMDFh">The festival really started to pick up when the sun edged over the horizon and the world washed orange. With the last of their daily duties completed, the citizens of Prismarche flooded the streets and shed all shreds of restraint. People loved to celebrate, and there was no better opportunity than this: the day that marked a hundred years freed from the Cataclysms that had once ravaged the world.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZWJiMDZhNGVmODQwNGFhZTljMjEwN2IzYWE2MGRi">Not that the newer generation understood firsthand what monstrosities used to crawl these lands. The Rampant Genesis of the Flesh-Weaver, the Crimson Blight brought by the Reaper of the Lost Harvest, the Great Conflagrations called down by the Ashen Hierophant to scour entire cities.</p>
<p class="cnM4NjgwMjI1OWZjMjRiMjc4NjA2OGNhNmZhN2Q4NGZh">The game had never shied from displaying the Cataclysms in a gruesome light, the carnage left in their wake and how the world was affected. She shuddered to imagine how the inhabitants, translated into reality, remembered them. No wonder the populace revered the Party of Heroes even a century later. They had saved this world from incomprehensible terrors.</p>
<p class="cnM5NDNjZjlhOTZjMjRjZTRhNzZkYmZiNmFhOWI2NDJl">Vivi preferred huddling in a dark room with a blanket over her shoulders most nights, but she did enjoy slinking out on occasion, and being in this new body and this new world made her more comfortable with the unknown than usual. She outright enjoyed walking through the cheering crowds. Droplets of ale caught her cheek as men slammed tankards, cheering and singing as they clutched each other by the shoulder, already so drunk they struggled to stand. She only felt slightly claustrophobic by the press of bodies. Emotion was infectious, and the only emotion now was revelry thick as molasses.</p>
<p class="cnNkOTFiOTRlZDEwMzQyYjBhNTY1NjcyYmQyMTMxMWYw">Vivi could still get drunk, she discovered.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTlmNTlmMDY5NzQxODI5MzNmNTE3NDg5OTU4NTA1">She didn’t go to parties often…or like, ever, in recent years…but the universal salve to awkwardness was alcohol, and she didn’t mind partaking when the opportunity called for it. It was hard to resist even if she wanted to when everyone in sight had a cup in hand and the obvious glow of intoxication about them.</p>
<p class="cnNiODJmMjU3OWQxYjQwYmY5YjhlMWY4MGJkOGJiNzcx">She didn’t overindulge, though. Only had a few. She ate a lot of street food—the fried balls of batter with gooey insides as delicious as anything she’d ever tasted—and congealed into the masses. She didn’t linger anywhere long, or talk to anyone beyond frivolities, since she didn’t belong here, not on any level big or small. She was a ghostly spectator.</p>
<p class="cnM2NWM0MWUwY2IyODRjYzk5M2FhMjQ2NzE3OTY2NDk2">Around ten at night one of the truly extravagant displays organized in the town square: a parade. Floats trundled through as people cheered from behind guardrails. To her interest, amusement, and horror, it was a series representing the Cataclysms. In order, from start to finish as Vivi remembered clearing them.</p>
<p class="cnMyZjQ4ZmZiZDg5OTRmZTM5ZjhiMjE1MDIyM2U4MWI4">Leading the procession was a hunched-over lich jerking forward on a withered black staff. Actors in masks, warriors and rogues and mages, fended his minions off. The Umbral Regent, bringer of the Cataclysm of Eternal Twilight. Though not realistic to the campaigns Vivi remembered, the representation was clear.</p>
<p class="cnMyN2RjMDcxMzU3MzRjYmE4Y2NlMzdhYTI5NDM0MzU2">Then the second of the Cataclysms: The Crimson Blight wrought by the Reaper of the Lost Harvest. Plagues and starvation, led by a husk of a human in red robes. Also valiantly defeated.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZThhNTg1YWZhZTQwNzA5YTY5ZmFmOGQxNzM0YTBl">The Cataclysm of the Hungry Deep. A kraken—the Maw of the Abyss—leading raiding parties of fish-like humanoids emerging in masses from the ocean. The beast had terrorized the coasts and isles of this world since time immemorial.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZDM1ZDA5ZWM0YjRmYzg4YjljZGFhN2I2ODJkNTcy">Rampant Genesis. The Flesh-Weaver and his grotesque creations, haunting the otherwise peaceful elven forests.</p>
<p class="cnM0Nzg5ODlhYTc0OTQ5ODQ4NjA0Y2ZlYTMyMDM5ZmIy">Sundered Earth. The Colossus, straightforward in raw destruction, but claiming more lives than any besides the final Cataclysm.</p>
<p class="cnM2Mzc3NjhhODBjYTQ1NzlhOTg0MmUwMjJhNjdmMDU1">Fractured Time and the Shattered Oracle, a cautionary tale for peering too deeply into the most profound and esoteric magics. The least destructive, but the most horrifying in many ways, his victims trapped for millennia in alcoves of stuttering time—or equally terrible fates.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTA2OTczOTRjOTRiMWRhZDRmNDY4OTJlZTBmZWEw">And lastly, The Ashen Hierophant, twelve-foot titan of black plate armor. He was the most accurately represented Monarch, maybe because Prismarche knew his presence intimately even after the years. His fires had cleansed more lives than disease, age, and famine combined. Entire expanses of the continent laid to waste, scars lingering a century later.</p>
<p class="cnM2NmI0OTUyNjc1NjQ5OWNhYWM0MjUxZWQ2NjA5ZWZh">It was strange to watch such monsters cheered and jeered at, with such a lack of grimness, but it solidified the idea that the Cataclysms were relics of the past. Few to none of the people here had any clue what those monsters had been like, so there was no solemnness or genuine relief. That was a good thing, she supposed.</p>
<p class="cnNiMGY1M2U3ZDRiMzQ0MDZiYzViYTU2MjEzNTIyZjlj">Eventually the parade wound down. The crowd drifted away to return to other festivities.</p>
<p class="cnNjZGE3MTUzZjI2OTRiNWQ5YzMzYWIyY2ExN2M0MjQ0">The next major event happened an hour later. Fireworks.</p>
<p class="cnMwY2JmNmEyZGRmMTRmYTNiZDVmMmNhMDc3MzRlZjg1">They were positioned right outside the city’s walls so everyone could see them. People seemed fascinated, pointing with wide eyes and grinning at the display, but Vivi found herself disappointed. She had expected more. The bursts of color were simply pitiful.</p>
<p class="cnNhZjNlMjM3YmZmNjRjNmU5NjgyZDhjM2E3ZmU1ZTI4">She guessed that while technology had improved, the people of this world were far behind her own. Fireworks were much more impressive after centuries of development, even if these people had magic on their side.</p>
<p class="cnM4YzQzNWI1ZGI2MzQ2Njg5NDgwODFiZTUzNWU3N2Uy">Looking back, it was probably her tipsiness at fault for her upcoming poor decision making. A whim guided her, and she didn’t think better of it. Caught up in the excited revelry, she wanted to give the city of Prismarche a real show. Fireworks as she knew them. And perhaps amplified a few times over to impress.</p>
<p class="cnNmYmRjYjBmZWZiNTRlNjA5YzNjNTk5NTBkZDM3MjBk">Part of it was also how she wanted to experiment with her magical abilities. Casting system-recognized spells, the ones logged in her ability list carried over from Seven Cataclysms, was fascinating, but she knew instinctively she could make her own too. Seeing the paltry display of explosions and lights made up her mind. She would give Prismarche a spectacle befitting the circumstances.</p>
<p class="cnMyODcwNThkNzk1ODQ2Njc4ODk4Y2FhYTgyMDBjYjIz">She extracted herself from the crowd and found a secluded alleyway then closed her eyes to delve into the memories of her new body.</p>
<p class="cnM5MmIzYmRhNWNiMzQxYmU4YmI5Yjk2MTU0ZmQ2ODRl">Vivisari Vexaria was the world’s eminent power in sorcery. She was no god, but as far as magic went, she was the closest mortal to being so. And that wealth of knowledge lurked in Vivienne’s head now.</p>
<p class="cnM5NTc3ZDFkODVlZDQ3NDA4NTBkZjY1NWVkNTA0NDFj">Creating a new spell wasn’t a simple task, even as an expert. But neither was it overly complicated, not for a mage of Vivisari’s caliber.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDk0ZGE5MDAwNDRiMWJiY2QxNmM3MDE0YTJkYjA3">Bit by bit an arcane circle formed in her mind. Her [Grand Fireworks] spell utilized two branches of magic: elemental and illusory. Mostly fake, but a tad real. For the scale she wanted, if she used purely elemental magic, she might cause real harm.</p>
<p class="cnM5MTI2YjBjZmU3OTQ4ODU5NGY0YzUzOTIwNzVkYTJh">As Prismarche’s display came to an end, she finalized her creation. She drew mana from herself, shaped it, and incanted her first self-created spell.</p>
<p class="cnMwYmVjOTYzMjVhYTRkNDRiODczMjM4NDcwOTE4OTI4">“[Grand Fireworks].”</p>
<p class="cnNkZGQyNGM5N2ZhNjQ3Njg4YTI1NDgxYWI5MDcxMDJl">A trail of red light flew from her staff as Prismarche’s fireworks ended, the so-called ‘grand finale’ settling into a dark sky. Vivi’s ember hung high above the center of the city for a long, suspended moment, all eyes drawn to its burning presence.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZGZhMTc1YWE2OTQwZmNiN2I3NDc1YTU0MzA5ZDlk">Then it exploded.</p>

## Chapter 13: 13 - Proposal


                <p class="cnM3ZWFhOGI2NzZjNjQ3YWU5ZmFkMTI5OGM5YWI3ZmIx">Guard Captain Soren rubbed his forehead as he received the brief from the City Guard’s highest-level magical consultant. At low mithril, and Institute-educated, Marcus was no neophyte mage, and indeed had a prestigious career ahead of him. Soren could trust what he said. Which was exactly the problem.</p>
<p class="cnNlYjUzMmZiNTFiZDQ5YjJhMGRmMjgyNjFkNWJmNzRi">“It was mostly illusory,” the boy was saying. “If not, it would have shattered every glass pane in the city and deafened anyone below silver rank.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNjZiMmQ2YjBmYjQxOTQ5ZjllZDQ5M2E1ZDkwMTM1">And wasn’t that a sobering statement? Bronze ranks were hardly the most durable sort, but they were well above the typical civilian in constitution. A spell that could shatter the eardrums of an entire city, including the bulk of their bronze rankers, was terrifying to consider even in the abstract.</p>
<p class="cnNkNWRkNTllMDQ5YjRmZGY4M2ViMzA3MWRjMzU1MTJl">“What tier was it?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTAwOWZmYmFmNTRiOTRiMWUwZmU3OWU0ZTk0MDIz">“I could only speculate.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMzU5ZjEzN2UxMjQ1ZWFiOTg0NTIzNWIwMDFhOTdm">“Do so.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNzc0NWVjZjhjNzRjODY4MTRlZTAyZTE0OGQxOWFl">The boy scratched the stubble on his chin as he debated internally. “Eleventh? Twelfth?” he finally settled on.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTE5N2FiM2ZhNTQzOTRhM2NhNDk5YWEwYzY2OWM2">Soren sat back in his chair, stunned. Level 1000 marked the defining line for Titled. Eleventh tier magic put the spellcaster above that by a hundred levels. Twelfth, by two hundred. Essentially a full ranking tier.</p>
<p class="cnNlNjc1NDAwZDA1ZDRjZTVhNGFmMDIzZmMwZWY1ODMw">“At least,” Marcus added. “It might be higher. Maybe much higher. I simply can’t make an accurate analysis. That level of spell is way beyond me. I just know it’s something I’ve never seen before. Even my instructors couldn’t have managed it, barring<em> perhaps </em>one of the Archmages.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMGU4NWY2ZjkwOTQ3NzBiNThmNTg2ZmM5NmJiMDhm">Somehow, he didn’t think Marcus had underestimated the spell. He hadn’t seen it himself, locked up in his office, but he’d heard it. Heavens above, he’d heard it. “So we have an unknown Titled in the city. A mage of at least Institute Archmage quality.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMWI0NDE3NzZmNDRmMzY5NjlmNGNjYzViM2VkOTY1">Titled. It wasn’t a strictly accurate descriptor, since Titled were recognized by a Kingdom—or by the elves, demons, or dwarves—but the term had become shorthand for ‘absurdly powerful individual’.</p>
<p class="cnM0MjFiYWI4NjBlOTRmMjE5YTAzMTRmNGQ3NWViNjkx">“Power,” Marcus corrected. “The power of an archmage. Not necessarily quality.”</p>
<p class="cnNmZTlhNjUxMmJjZTRkOWQ4NGMzZDZiYTQ0ODhmNTUw">Soren didn’t comment on the pedantry. “Do we need to be concerned?”</p>
<p class="cnM2OWYwZGVhNzk4OTRlYWY5ODc2NjQwMGRmZmUyZWM4">“I don’t believe so. The illusory aspect was intentional. He was…considerate. He wanted to impress but not cause damage. To add to the festival. A rogue element, but a friendly one, or at least one without malicious intent.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDdlNGRjNWI1ZTQwMWNiMmU3YTBjMzMzNjJhZTc2">He?</p>
<p class="cnMzMmUxYjViZGRlNTQwY2VhYThhNGJlOWVhNGJmYWFl">Soren realized only then that he had a suspect in mind. And it wasn’t a ‘he’. An image of bored red eyes and a slight, condescending frown filled his thoughts.</p>
<p class="cnMyYjQwZGU2ODFkMzQ5YTVhODY1YWY3ZjdkZjFkMjM0">Was it coincidence? Throwing around and detaining mithril ranks was impressive, but Prismarche had at least six orichalcum-ranks and a Titled inside its borders. The feat didn’t qualify as something that woman alone was capable of. She had just been in the right place at the right time to mete out justice.</p>
<p class="cnMyMjkwNDVhMzhkYzRlYWVhYWY1MzFiNmYxZWU1Mjdi">That said, only one of those individuals was a mage, and he didn’t fit the description.</p>
<p class="cnNlMzllMzg5ZGU1ZTQ3YTU4MWM4MTdjOTFjZDc4YWQ1">Soren rubbed his temples. “At least the city got a show out of it,” he said sardonically. “If we find—him,” he corrected at the last second, “we ought to thank him.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMTIyMmRhYjY2ZDRhNGI4MmIyY2UwNGRjMjIzYmE1">“I’m not sure we should approach that person at all,” Marcus said bluntly. “Malicious intent or not, Titled are dangerous. Especially one who hasn’t announced himself.”</p>
<p class="cnM1YjdiZWY5MTcyYzQ1ZTliZGY1ZmI4NjI3OTY5MDAz">Soren grunted. He certainly wouldn’t offer disagreement there.</p>
<hr>
<p class="cnNlYjI3YTcwNTU0ZTRhY2NiNTMyY2RjODViZWNhYzll">Saffra stared at the demon in the alleyway, staff raised to the sky, the aftermath of her spell still booming through the city.</p>
<p class="cnM5YjkzN2M0MGJlMTQyNDBhNWU1ZGYwOGQ2Njc4YmUw">It had been coincidence she’d spotted the long, sharp ears of the woman who’d helped her earlier—who she owed her life to. Saffra had been wandering the crowds, feeling satisfied from her successful mission, when Vivi’s distinctive figure had pulled her gaze. She’d felt guilty stalking her around, but her curiosity had been piqued. Just who <em>was </em>this woman?</p>
<p class="cnM1NGNiYjE0NTBlNjQ3YTViYjdjYTBmNTU3MTRjMjM0">She’d clearly had a few drinks. It was comically easy to follow her without being noticed. Why did the lack of alertness make her feel so much more comfortable? Probably because someone who could let their guard down wasn’t that bad of a person. It wasn’t a trait purely reserved for scum to always be looking over one’s shoulder, but it did trend that way.</p>
<p class="cnMxMTYwM2UzNWY4NjRkNTA5YmRkNDExY2EyYTg0Mzc4">So she’d prowled after the demon mage.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmY3NWIwMjE4NTQwYzJiMjk1NTZjZjhmZjQ1ZGE1">Then…this had happened.</p>
<p class="cnMxY2ZiNjViZTRkNDRhOTU4OGIwODgyYWRlNzU3M2Uw">An explosion of branching, prismatic fire that engulfed the sky as far as the eye could see. Whose thunder grabbed her by the arms and shook her like a ragdoll. It was cacophonous. Cataclysmic. She would have sworn that the heavens themselves had descended to demonstrate their might and wonder in awesome pageantry.</p>
<p class="cnMyOWE2ZWU0ZWVkNzRkNTQ5YzAzZDE3YzNiZTJmYWIw">And the small demon mage in front of her had been the source.</p>
<p class="cnMyODAxOTQ2NTBkNTQwNTg4ODUyMDg3ZDZiZWRkNzBm">Saffra’s mistake was instinctively pulling together a defensive spell. She hadn’t been able to help herself, not with the world ending right above her. She was paranoid and quick to throw up defensive magic. Could she be blamed? Those instincts kept her alive.</p>
<p class="cnM4NTdiZDY1MzY1YzQwNzBiMDY0NWYwY2Q3YjJjOTZk">Sensing magic, the demon mage’s attention had instantly snapped toward her, and thus caught her at the mouth of the alleyway. It all happened in a handful of seconds, too fast to retreat around the corner.</p>
<p class="cnNlNTdlNzQxM2IyYTQ2MDdiN2VlNzQxOGFjNDBjNjNk">They held each other’s gazes for a moment.</p>
<p class="cnM3NDdmNTNmZmRhYTQ0YTc5MGQ0MzgyNDQyZWY1ZTIz">Saffra might have bolted in some other circumstance. Run for her life. But despite how terrifying this woman was, something her instincts recognized, she herself had never been scared. Despite how she could slap mithril-ranks around like low-bronze apprentices, this woman wasn’t dangerous. Not in the way that mattered. Saffra—the higher-order, more logical part of her brain, the part that made her <em>her</em>—had never feared Vivi.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDRmNGU1YTJmMjQ2YTY4YjYzNWIxMGE3OWQ2NWZk">So she stepped out around the alleyway’s corner, put one hand on her hip and pointed with the other, and announced:</p><span class="cjBlMzk4MzMxNTU3MDRkYTU4YWIwMGEzY2NkZjIwMDg0"><br>This narrative has been unlawfully taken from Royal Road. If you see it on Amazon, please report it.<br></span>
<p class="cnMyMTU1OTVmODI3MTQyOWM4NGQyYjFlZDFkNDkxYjdh">“I want you to teach me. I’m your apprentice now.”</p>
<p class="cnMwZjdkNTZhOTNiNjQ2MGE4ODYxNTExOGY3MmVlZDlj">The words caught Saffra herself by surprise as much as they did the demon mage.</p>
<p class="cnNmZTM2MDQxZTllZDQyZjQ4OTAxNzZkOTQxZDEyNDhj">They both took a moment to be stunned.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzAyZTMyMjY3YzQxMjJiNmE3ODVmMzRmOGJlMTIz">Saffra’s cheeks heated up, but she was in bluster mode now.</p>
<p class="cnMxYWJhNTMxMjM3NjRjY2FhYWI0ODc4MDI4M2E4NDc1">She took a stab in the dark, phrased in an ambiguous enough manner she could deflect if needed. “I know about Daisy and her cat, by the way.”</p>
<p class="cnNmNzIwMzI3MGQxMDQ5NjU5ZjIwMzM4YjBiMzRmNWRh">Vivi’s eyes widened, and Saffra wondered if that meant what she thought it did. Though she didn’t know what she thought herself. Had Vivi been involved, somehow, with Monocle’s rescue? She didn’t see how that could be possible.</p>
<p class="cnMxM2VkY2ViNmQ1YzQ1MTViODA0Yzg5ZDgyZGY1NmQ2">She had only said the words to throw the woman off, to be honest.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTM5MTJmYjBjNDRhOWE5OTdkNmJlYjU1NDRkNDJh">“I’m partially Institute trained,” Saffra announced as her credentials, realizing a second later maybe she shouldn’t have, since expulsion suggested some condemning things about her. “I know a fifth tier spell even though I’m level three hundred and eighty-five.” She could likely pass the gold-rank exam. She had intended on taking the one coming up in two weeks. “I won’t be a bother, I can take care of myself. I’ve been living alone for years. I can cook, clean, run errands, take notes, and do anything else you might need of an apprentice.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MTEwYzA1Yzk2ZjRkMGM5OTI3ZTJiZTM2MmJmZjZi">Trying to sell the idea to this woman mortified her. She didn’t know why she was. She hadn’t planned this. The words had blurted out of her mouth, and now she was just attempting to support them.</p>
<p class="cnMwZmE2OTdmMTM4YjRlZDc5ZWYwOGM2NjRmNGViMzBm">The woman stared at her, and Saffra felt the heat on her face intensify. She felt ridiculous. At least she didn’t outright laugh at her, which would have been deserved.</p>
<p class="cnMwZTcyZWQ5YjJlZTQwZjZhYjJjNDk3OGFiZDVkZDI5">And really, even if an orichalcum rank—after the spell she’d just seen, she knew the woman was probably Titled, but she couldn’t digest that reality, and so settled on the more comfortable yet still incredible ‘orichalcum’—was willing to apprentice some girl she didn’t know, why would it be Saffra?</p>
<p class="cnMxMjA0NzZkNGIzMDQzNTZiYWQ1MzZjN2MzNjBkZTU4">She really was talented, but not the sort of talented that would impress an orichalcum. She really was Institute educated, but she’d been expelled. The only aspect where she stood out, sadly, was the mundane one. She was much more independent than most thirteen-year-old girls. She had traveled across half the human kingdoms and knew what the world was like, intimately so.</p>
<p class="cnNiZGM0NWQwNDUyNzRkNzliNzNjNWQwM2RmZWMyZjRl">Not to mention how rudely she’d gone about it. ‘I’m your apprentice now’? That happened a lot, where she said things like that out of—not a defense mechanism, she refused to call it that, since she didn’t <em>need </em>defense mechanisms.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZDViYjY2ZjQxMTRiNDM4NDM2YWZlOTVmNTg0ZGRj">She lifted her chin higher, readying herself for the obvious answer. Why was she so invested, now, despite not having planned this, and knowing what the woman’s response would be?</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjJiMDc5MjkwNjQwNTJhZTYxOGQwNGIxMzA0MWRi">“I doubt I’d make a good teacher,” the demon woman mused. “And I’ll be leaving the city tomorrow morning. Don’t you have friends here, or teammates?”</p>
<p class="cnNhZmYwMzdmNDBiNjRjMDc4MjZkNjk2MmQ3ZGU5NTYz">The words were so unexpected Saffra almost failed to understand them. Because the mage’s immediate response should have been something along the lines of ‘is this a joke?’ or ‘you can’t be serious,’ even if she had been kind enough to not outright laugh at her.</p>
<p class="cnM3YzdkNzA4NmQ3MzQ2Mjg5NjZjZTdlNDlkODM2NjQ4">“Um. N-Not really,” she responded, caught off guard. “I don’t really...” She cut off and corrected herself. “People don’t make friends with me easily.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNTI0MDdiYWQ3ZDQxNDlhNDU3NTJlNTJhZTYwMTU2">Which was their fault, obviously.</p>
<p class="cnNhMjQ5ZjkyNTFkMzRhZDM4Yjc1MjY1MTEyOWQwMzFi">Even if she did have friends, she would be idiotic not to take an apprenticeship under a mage of this caliber. It might be superior to an Institute education. And seeing how that door was closed to her, this might be her only remaining hope for growth as a mage.</p>
<p class="cnMwMGY1Zjc4NTNlZDRiMzhhNDc3ODMyNGUyYWQ0MmRh">Which, now that she thought about it, explained why she was so desperate. Nothing in existence could make her beg, but for a second, she considered whether she should.</p>
<p class="cnNmMjZhZmQ5OTA2ZDRhNzBhYWVjNTEwMTUwNmE3NjFj">“What’s the tier five spell you know?” Vivi asked, again catching Saffra by surprise.</p>
<p class="cnNmMmMxYjcwYjVjNjQxN2RhZjI3ZWZiZDljMTRhNDU0">She grew flustered. Tier five was nothing. [Farsight], tier six. [Invisibility], tier seven. [Blink], tier <em>nine</em>. And likely some form of [Greater Telekinesis], after she thought about that encounter in the Glade. All of them silently incanted and their spell signatures masked.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZGNlMTFmOTIxNzQxNjViNzQ0YmI4ZTQzZmNhMmE3">Never mind how this woman had lit up the entire sky with magical fireworks, a minute earlier. What monstrous tier of magic had that been?</p>
<p class="cnM5MjEzMWQwYzYwMTQ1ZmE4YjgzMGZkMDg2ZmRjZjI0">Her best spell was a tier zero [Illuminate] in comparison.</p>
<p class="cnNkNzhlZDkzYzM0NzRhM2M5ZWEyZTQ1YmFmMWU0ZjNm">The self-doubt didn’t show in her voice. She announced with total confidence, “[Fireball]. A fully fledged one, not some imitation. My specialty is elemental magic, and I know tier four ice and fire spells too, despite not having reached level four hundred yet.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNGRkNTYxMzVlZDRhYWU5M2VjMzUwZGVkNTMzOTg4">“[Fireball]?” The demon considered this, then nodded. “I suppose my specialty is also war magic.”</p>
<p class="cnNiOTU4NDRhOThkMDQ1Y2ViMGRiMGQ3NWVhZTI5MWE1">Idly, she raised a hand, and Saffra felt magic fill the air. For the first time, she saw the woman cast without suppressing the visual indicators—which was something few mages could do anyway. A spell diagram etched itself into reality in glowing white symbols.</p>
<p class="cnM1MDQzODUxYTFjMTQ5MDdiNmM3NGNmNTJlMGY5ZDgy">Circles described a spell’s function using the language of magic itself. They were disgustingly complex, and she doubted anyone truly<em> </em>understood every glyph and how they combined, even for basic spells. Spell circles weren’t even consistent between usages. Mostly the same, yes, but a painter couldn’t paint the same artwork twice, not identically, not down to the exact brush strokes.</p>
<p class="cnM5Zjk3MGQ0ZjZhYjQyMDhhYmUyNzI2ZjZkMWM4OTE0">One comparison her instructors liked to use was that casting spells was like ‘writing poetry in a language you only half understood’. But even with fake words, there was a sort of intuition, a feel for flow and rhythm, that made a good or bad mage.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDZmZGYzNmQzMzRjN2Y4Y2ZmNWI0Y2NkNDQ2MTZh">Or another metaphor, equally preferred by the instructors: Magic was a wild beast, a half-tamed lion, and spell circles were the commands a mage barked at it. A good tamer was almost always obeyed, but that didn’t mean they<em> </em>understood how their words were being interpreted in the head of a wild beast.</p>
<p class="cnMwNGUwNmMzZTU3NDRiNTE5OTQzYjdjY2M2ZmNhNTQx">Learning the fundamentals was important, but when it came down to it, magic was more art than science.</p>
<p class="cnNhOTdmYmQ0ZDU2YTQwYzI5ZjBkNWQ3ZDJmNzhiYTU2">Saffra looked at Vivi’s spell circle. Spell circles had a certain flavor to them, a handwriting, a style. Lady Vivi’s was old. The design gave her the impression of something she would find in a dusty scroll in the corner of the Institute’s sprawling library. Not <em>ancient</em>, but antiquated, something her grandmother’s grandmother’s grandmother might have cast.</p>
<p class="cnM4NzgyOWJjY2IwMDQxNzNiYjFkOGY5YmRiNDZkOWYy">But old didn’t mean poorly executed. Saffra wasn’t new to magic—she had developed the talent early, casting her first spell at six years old. Seven years wasn’t much experience compared to some mages, especially elvish or demonic ones, but she knew how to read and interpret magic.</p>
<p class="cnM2Njc0NmUwMWE0MDQyNmY5NzJlOWU5N2RjNzBiYTY1">She wasn’t surprised Lady Vivi’s spell was so perfectly executed as to be painful to look at, in that sort of way someone aspiring toward competency herself might look at a masterpiece and despair. First impressions of arcane diagrams were more like those gotten from a painting: there weren’t indicators that a painting was ‘right’ or ‘wrong’, not objective ones, but mastery was obvious at first glance no matter the style.</p>
<p class="cnNhZGE5MTlhOTA5MjQ5OGM5NjY4ZmIyZjc3MDFlZWQ3">The spell activated. A truly staggering ball of fire spawned in the center of the alleyway—then disappeared before Saffra even had a chance to be horrified.</p>
<p class="cnMwNDlmYzcwZjZmZTRjNDA5ZGMyNGYzMWYyODg2YWM4">“[Dispel],” Vivi said, casually flicking her wrist.</p>
<p class="cnM5YzkwZjc5ZGE1MTRiY2ZiZTk4ZDA5MDRjMWE4N2Fj">Cast in an instant, not that Saffra could be surprised at this point.</p>
<p class="cnMyOTRkMjc5ZWZlOTRlYThiZjgyYTdiZDg5NWRmZWY0">She knew the demon hadn’t done any of it to show off. She’d cast ninth-tier magic in front of her already. Obscenely complex ninth-tier magic too, since spatial magics were infamously unwieldy.</p>
<p class="cnNkODM5MWRhOWViNzQ2NmViYTYwZDRhZWM5NjcxZmMy">She had simply been recalling what the spell [Fireball] was like. Reminiscing, perhaps. And maybe revealing the spell circle for Saffra’s own sake. But fifth-tier magic was so far behind this mage that it was probably <em>quaint</em> to her.</p>
<p class="cnNmZDUzMmM5YTQ1MTQyZWQ5MGE0OWNkMWFkYzQ0Njhm">Saffra had been so fascinated by the display that she’d briefly forgotten what they’d been talking about.</p>
<p class="cnMxODkyOGFlMWMyYzRmYjM5OTk5NmU4ZDU4Y2U2M2Rk">“I expect I’ll be occupied with my own business, so I’m not sure how much time I could spare,” the woman said. “And I doubt I would make a good teacher. But I’m in need of an assistant, I suppose. A trustworthy one. The world has changed while I was…occupied, for the past many decades. I believe you’re both a young woman worth training, and someone I can trust. So if it’s your request, and if you understand those limitations, I would be inclined to accept. Are you sure it’s what you want?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNWRlNjRjZGU3OTQ1MGQ5ZWY5MjhjOGFlZGY5NzFk">She suspected the long, stunned silence and her stutter betrayed the aloofness of her response.</p>
<p class="cnNhYmJhYjEyY2U4MjQ2YmY5Y2I1NmYyMGI2Y2M3MzRm">“Y-Yes. Of course.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNjZhMTU3YjI4ZjQ0OGQ5NDViYThhYmU3NmFmZTU1">She probably should say more, but she genuinely didn’t know what.</p>
<p class="cnM2NjRmM2I2NzRlYTQ3NTBhOWExNWZmNmYwOTVlODhi">It didn’t make sense.</p>
<p class="cnNmY2ViZThjOGEzMTQyZmI5ZTEzYjY4ZmZmZjE0NDIx">This orichalcum rank—quite likely higher—had said <em>yes </em>to teaching her?</p>
<p class="cnMwOTBhMGYxOGE1MTRiZjRiMjc5MmU3MDk2ZTIzNWRh">Why?!</p>

## Chapter 14: 14 - Rift


                <p class="cnNjOGIwZWY2NDFkYzQ0Mzc5ODU3NGYyZTIyYWUyMDUz">Vivi hadn’t intended to pick up an apprentice. The buzz of alcohol wasn’t even to blame for her quick decision, like with [Grand Fireworks].</p>
<p class="cnMyNmUxYmYyMDdjODQ0N2JiZTdlZGE0YzJhNGVkOTI0">Speaking of that—the spell had been spectacular. She had certainly accomplished her goal of putting on a show. Too much so. The resulting explosion had shocked even her. At least she hadn’t hurt anyone. As far as semi-drunken mistakes went, things could have gone worse.</p>
<p class="cnM5YWYxMjE2MGI4NzQwZTNiM2I5YTY1ODEyMDQ5MjA5">She told Saffra to enjoy the festival and meet up with her in the Adventurer’s Guild in the morning. The prospect of apprenticeship warranted a longer conversation, but only after Vivi had her wits about her and time to think. Saffra seemed shell-shocked that Vivi had accepted, and had obeyed with surprisingly little protest. She’d asked no further questions, just shuffled off, too stunned to speak.</p>
<p class="cnM4NWUwMDliODM5MTRiOWFhNjJkYzQ3MjVkNjhiZmNh">Vivi wasn’t sure whether she’d made the right decision. Her logic was sound: Having a pseudo-apprentice to answer questions while getting her bearings <em>would </em>be useful.</p>
<p class="cnNiNDNmODQ0OTEyNTQxOWJiZDIxOTYxODk1MGNhMzk1">But more importantly, Saffra hadn’t had the easiest life. Anyone could see that. The presumable lack of parents, the attitude, how she was a fully-fledged adventurer despite being somewhere around thirteen. And most relevantly of all, how she’d seen through those two monsters despite no one else in the Adventurer’s Guild having a clue.</p>
<p class="cnNkY2I4ZjRkY2NmNzRlYTA5ZjAxODJmMjE1MDkxMmJl">Despite her past, though, Saffra was constantly looking to help people. First Allen, then Daisy. Of course Vivi would agree to teaching her a few things. She had made it clear she might not be a suitable teacher, and that this might not be a ‘full apprenticeship’ like what she expected, but if Vivi could help the girl, she would.</p>
<p class="cnM5NzUxYjMzNTI5NDQ5YzNhMmQ3YTY4ZTYxNDlkMjE3">She normally did her best to avoid responsibilities, but this was an extenuating circumstance. Saffra needed someone to look after her. Make sure she didn’t run into another disaster like what had happened earlier today. Somehow, Vivi intuited it wasn’t the first horrible thing she’d seen, or the second. She had bounced back too quickly, and been too quick to recognize the truth of what Lailah and her partner were.</p>
<p class="cnNmOTIxZjdmMjgwMzQ1M2RhYzhmOWI3ZjJiNGU4NGMz">Maybe there was one more reason she had agreed. Vivi, too, had been on her own from an early age. Maybe she empathized with the girl’s situation.</p>
<p class="cnM4MjcyZmQ3YjZkZTQ1MDRhNzg0ZjYwNTg1OThlYzY5">She returned to the celebrations, though much of the revelry had drained from her, and having determined not to drink any more, she found herself slinking away to more private locations: namely a rooftop near where a band was playing, the noises booming off in all directions, magically amplified.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzJlZjU4MmVkYzRmM2NiYjQ3M2M5YWUxZmNkYzQ2">She was lying, tapping her foot with her eyes closed as she enjoyed the festival from the more comfortable safety of her secluded hiding spot, when she discovered that the night had one more surprise in store.</p>
<p class="cnNhNGVhM2ViOGQ4NTQ3NmY4MjMwNGU2M2NiZmQzNDNh"><em>Crack</em>.</p>
<p class="cnM1M2JkY2NiZjg1ZTQ2MjFiZGFlZGQ3NjIyNzg0YTFh">Something broke. Eyes snapping open, she scrambled to her feet. It invoked that kind of dawning horror a person might feel seeing a friend slip off a ledge and hear something of theirs go <em>crunch.</em></p>
<p class="cnMyODk4ZWQ3YTRjMDRhM2NhNTFlMTg3NmI1ZDBiOTZm">Something bad had happened. Something terrible. Ruinous.</p>
<p class="cnMyYzgwMWQxYWM1OTQ1OGM4NGRjMTAxNGU2MGZlZmY3">Above, the starlit night sky had shattered like a hammer striking a pane of glass. Black and violet fractures spread out like spiderwebs in all directions.</p>
<p class="cnMwNTQ5ZDcyMTMzZTQ4Zjc5N2JlM2IwMzcwODhkM2Ji">Vivi’s staff was already summoned and outstretched. She braced herself for what might happen, but…</p>
<p class="cnMzNzJmN2I3ZGMzMTQ2YTViMjJjMmQ5M2VkMjQ5ZjA4">That was it.</p>
<p class="cnM5MzdjNzg1NTA2NjRhNjJiMTQ0NGU5YzNlMWFlYTcy">The festivities continued. Peace Day didn’t come to a burning, screeching halt. No one cried out or screamed. Indeed, she alone seemed to recognize what had happened.</p>
<p class="cnMyYjliNDM5MGVjYTQxN2Y4YTYzMjU3ZDEyOWEwNjMw">It was magical in origin. The festival-goers couldn’t see the starry night shattered into a million pieces. Could other mages? Surely the higher-tier ones. There was no way what had happened had flown completely under the radar.</p>
<p class="cnNmMmM2MmM2ZGYwNzQ4YmU4MjJjOGNkOGRjNzk0Njhh">When she was certain the phenomenon was just the ice cracking, but not the entire lake she was standing on about to collapse, she relaxed and studied the disaster’s mana signature.</p>
<p class="cnNiN2U1MDZiZmE3MDQyNzZhZDEyNTU3MzdhNDM3YzY2">It was…dimensional in origin, she realized. If there was one branch of magic that even Vivisari was a beginner in—and yes, she meant Vivisari, not her, Vivienne—it was dimensional magic. She had more experience even with meddling with time, and only thanks to the campaigns involving the Shattered Oracle.</p>
<p class="cnMyZTZjOGM1ZjVmNDQ2OWFiYzAxNzlkYTNiOTc3YTc5">In fact, it was those memories that the image above reminded her of. The Shattered Oracle’s experiments that had driven him mad and turned him into a Cataclysm millennia ago. His tinkering with magics best left alone.</p>
<p class="cnM4NmZjNzdkMGMyZDQxZDc5NGY5NmRjNmMyMTA4NDAz">Except on a grander scale. The shattering spanned the entirety of Prismarche. What in God’s name had happened here?</p>
<p class="cnNmNmE1MDU1YmVlYzRlMWFhOWU4NTEwYjlhZjk2OTk0">When she was certain reality wasn’t about to collapse, she released a breath she didn’t know she’d been holding.</p>
<p class="cnNiNGJjZDAxOGM3YzQzNjdiZWNiN2I1Nzk0MjEzZjg1">It looked like the festival was over. For her, at least. The revelry continued below with no signs of stopping.</p>
<p class="cnM2NGU5MDBjNTM1OTRjZTI4YzliNThhYWZlZmZlNWE2">After a moment’s consideration, she went to find the Guard Captain. That seemed like a logical first step. She had no idea how to go about evacuation if it were necessary, or what the standard procedure for a ‘nascent calamity’ was.</p>
<p class="cnM5NGM2ZGVlZmMzZTRjMGNhODhiNzhhMTljZjAyNmQw">The guards at the nearest gatehouse were happy to point her his way. While she’d been under scrutiny earlier, she had captured two of the worst sorts of criminals, so she had the City Guard’s respect. Even if it was a wary sort.</p>
<p class="cnNhZmVkOGJjMDExMjQ4NTliYzgzNjE3YzEwMTkxZGM3">The Guard Captain was in his office. He was too high up the hierarchy to be doing anything as mundane as patrolling, yet, ironically, not low enough he could be excused to enjoy the festival on a night as important as this.</p>
<p class="cnNkYzUyY2M2YWI2MTQyNDNiZjkzYTNkZDY1NTRiMWNj">He was already on his feet when a guard escorted her in. “Lady Adventurer,” he said smoothly, but with obvious concern for her unexpected presence. “I’m afraid the supply requisition is still underway, but we should—”</p><span class="cjFiMjc3NmRmOWYyZTQ0N2RiOTkzNDJlNmZiNzM5ZjE1"><br>If you spot this tale on Amazon, know that it has been stolen. Report the violation.<br></span>
<p class="cnNmZTNkMjY3NjcyNTQwNDJhN2NhY2VkNTQyYjgwMjlh">“You haven’t gotten a report?”</p>
<p class="cnNiMmY2YzE0NzhiZjQyMGRiMTM0MDE5MjdkY2UzOWY0">His brow furrowed. “For…the fireworks spell, I presume?”</p>
<p class="cnNkZDNlNzkyOTE0ZTQ5ZThhMDA3ZDM2Zjk4MTUxNWM1">She stared at him, then cleared her throat. “Not that. Who’s the highest level mage in the city right now?”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZjYzZDI0YTRmOTRhZTI5YTU5MzM1ZTk1YTdmNDQ5">He studied her for a moment, then his attention seemed to sharpen. He could sense that something was off. This was a man not unused to taking action, so while most people would have needed time to adjust to the scenario, he replied seamlessly, “There is an orichalcum rank, but we have no means of contacting him quickly, if this is urgent.”</p>
<p class="cnMzZjcwYWJlNzkwZDQyOTRhMzA4NjM4ZmRmZTVjMjdm">She grimaced—mentally, at least. Her face remained serene as always. “Who <em>can</em> you contact, of a reasonable level?”</p>
<p class="cnNiOWU5OWNjNjhjODQ3ZGViMjNhZjRjMzk4ZDEyNjg0">“The guard keeps a magical consultant on standby for major events such as today. Marcus Caldwick. Over level seven hundred, and Institute educated, if that matters.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNzE5Njg3ZjgxNDQ2MTg4NzRjZWU4ZDFjOTdjZWU0">“Seven hundred? That’s it?”</p>
<p class="cnMzYWIyMjNhYjc4NjQwYWM4NTJmYTRmODViNDQ0ZTli">His eyebrows shot to his hairline, and she dismissed the incoming exchange with a flick of her wrist. Yes, yes, her perspective was skewed.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZGQ2ZGYwOWIwNDQxNWZiMjAwNGYwOTU2MzhmMTY4">“Never mind. Lead me to him. Hopefully that’s high enough.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MjhhOTE1M2IzOTRlN2Q5ODM0OGVmY2RiNTVmNTBm">“For what, might I ask?”</p>
<p class="cnM2Y2MyOTMxNDY3NzQ4MTY5YTdkYjEzZmVmNzk0ZDM0">Vivi looked up at the ceiling, through the layers of stone and toward the enormous mana currents lingering in the air. The anomaly was stable. There didn’t seem to be a need for urgency, but neither was she going to dawdle considering the scale of what they were dealing with.</p>
<p class="cnM0YTI0OGZmYjRiYTQ5YjhiMzM4ZDNjNWM1ODViMTgz">The Guard Captain followed her gaze, seeming confused.</p>
<p class="cnMwZGQ3Y2Y3MjdhNTRiZWRiYWY1NzQ2NmNlNjVmNzcz">“There’s an anomaly. I’m the only one who can see it from what I can tell. I want another mage of reasonably high level to confirm.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MTU5M2NjOGExMjQ1ZTBhYzc1Mzc0OGQ2MGMxMzIy">The Guard Captain opened his mouth, probably to seek further clarification, but when Vivi glanced at the ceiling again, he closed it. He nodded. “Please, follow me.”</p>
<p class="cnMzODY1YzdhZTUxNDRjNzBhOWY4ZGM5NGE5ZTNiZDUw">A few minutes later, they were in a different office. Marcus stood at the unexpected intrusion of the Guard Captain.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjNlYTMwZTA1NTQxMjlhM2FjZGUwMzlhY2RhM2Y2">“Ah,” the dark-haired boy said, seeming highly interested when he saw Vivi come in. “You must be the visiting mage Captain Soren mentioned. It’s nice to—”</p>
<p class="cnM5MGRkOThiZTk1YzQzM2I5ZTI3OTQ4M2ZkMTk1MTk1">“Can I teleport you?” she interrupted.</p>
<p class="cnNkYmQ1NmZhMzA4MzQ1ZjZhNmQ5MjhjMjY5MmEzNzM0">“Er,” Marcus said, glancing at the Guard Captain.</p>
<p class="cnM5NzVlZmM0NDBiMjQzYTA5ZTZlYzQzMjk1N2RiNGU5">“Yes,” the Guard Captain answered for him, and that was enough permission for Vivi.</p>
<p class="cnNkYWY0M2EyZmVmZDQ1NGFiZTZlMWNjYzdmNGQ5NjAz">A moment later, the fabric of space spat them out on a nearby section of the city’s wall.</p>
<p class="cnNkMmUzMjJkMzVhNDQ0NTJhN2RjYWM0MjUwZTA4Yjk2">“Was that—a <em>multi-person </em>[Blink]?” Marcus asked incredulously. “Where was the spell circle? The invocation?” The dark-haired man was spinning around, more than a little disoriented.</p>
<p class="cnMzMmY3NzA2MDA1MDQzNGRhNTAxYzBkYWE0OTE0Yjlh">“Focus, Marcus,” the Guard Captain said. “Questions later. Something’s happened.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NGRhNmFlMGZlOTRlYzhiNjFkNzRjMTVjNWJkZGVh">Marcus wasn’t nearly as much of a soldier as Soren, because he took a few moments to sort himself out. Eventually, he shook his head to clear it and asked, “What is it?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNTVhNjgyNDA0MTRkMWNhOGFiODVlMjdiN2I2OTI0">She pointed at the sky.</p>
<p class="cnMyYzlkNWFiZjUzMTQwNjY5MWFkM2NkNGZiYjVkOTE5">Marcus followed her finger and squinted into the distance. A few seconds passed. “What, pray, am I looking for?”</p>
<p class="cnMzZDIyMGJkODI2YjQ3Y2JhMzg0OTcyZjcxOGYzMjg1">She had hoped he would just see it. To her refined senses, the starry night had shattered like a pane of glass. Was this high enough tier magic only <em>she</em> would be able to sense it? That would complicate things.</p>
<p class="cnNiZjEwZGFiM2MxMjRmOGI5ZTcxZDBlZTNmZDFlZGUw">“It looks like this,” Vivi said, drawing Marcus’s attention.</p>
<p class="cnMzYTYxMzU3MjkwMDQyOTY4ZjY0YmFjZDRkNzRhMDBi">She extruded mana into the air and manipulated it, imitating the currents she could see above—the echo of the lingering spell signature, or what part of it she could make out. She sucked the mana back into herself when she finished demonstrating.</p>
<p class="cnMwNmJiOGNjYzBkNDQ2M2I5MmNjNDU3MDRmMmYxMWM0">He seemed fascinated by the display. “That’s an <em>incredible</em> level of control,” he told her. “And<em> </em>a <em>very</em> interesting pattern, I’ve never seen anything like it. So <em>dense</em>. How many simultaneous flows were you manipulating? And is there really something…like that…up there…?”</p>
<p class="cnNkOGVlZTcyZWNjODRmM2Y5Y2NjOTE3ZWI4NTdjODJm">He trailed off, having studied the sky with Vivi’s rough model as a hint.</p>
<p class="cnM3Nzk5ODRlODMyZTRlODViODJjODJkNDMzODhhYzlj">It was obvious when he saw what she wanted him to. Confusion flickered on his expression first, head tilting. And then he <em>really</em> saw what the problem was, and he blanched. He stumbled backward, arms raising reflexively as if to defend himself.</p>
<p class="cnNiNmFiMmJiMGY3OTQwNzViYTcwZjY4ODYyY2JiNDQx">“What is it?” the Guard Captain asked.</p>
<p class="cnNmMDIyZDQ4YzZjZjQ5OGE4NmE5YzdjMDkxZmViYTBi">“What the hell <em>is</em> that?” Marcus stammered. “I—I can’t even—”</p>
<p class="cnNmNjA0OGQ5NjZlZTQxODM4ODFiOTNiMDI5NjM0NmQz">“What <em>is it?</em>” the Guard Captain demanded, all of his usual friendliness evaporated. It was an order from a superior to a soldier.</p>
<p class="cnNkZTgzODljZTc5MjQwOGJhMTgxOWM2MjY1MTYwMGEz">Marcus’s spine straightened by the sheer command in the Captain’s voice, and he faced Soren. He opened his mouth, about to answer—then closed it.</p>
<p class="cnNjN2VhZjMzMzZkMjRiNGFhNzcwNTY2MTUzYWFiMjI4">“I don’t know,” he said plainly. He looked at Vivi as if for help, almost pleadingly.</p>
<p class="cnMwYzQ5ZmFiOTkwMzQ1MTk4YjZkMTE2ZWEyM2RiYTgy">“Dimensional anomaly. I felt it the moment it happened. It was like the sky cracked.” Or reality itself. That was why she had panicked, why a sense of wrongness had jolted through her. “It’s been ten minutes or so.”</p>
<p class="cnM3NDFlM2I2ZmUxODQwZGJhOTlhZTM0Y2FiMWY1ZWY5">Weirdly, Marcus’s panic disappeared. He gave her an enormously dubious look. “<em>Dimensional? </em>That other dimensions exist is an <em>extremely </em>unlikely supposition, with no supporting evidence. Much less that magic as a fundamental force is even capable of interacting with such boundaries.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNTM1NjE1OGQ1ZDQ1ZmFhMmNlOThiZTMzYTc3YTk2">She stared at him. He shifted, growing embarrassed, but he didn’t back down.</p>
<p class="cnNmNmZlNmE5OTEzZDQ3ZTNhZDJjYmQ0YTA3MGE2MzAz">“That is nothing less than what most Grand Magi at the Institute would say.” He looked up at the sky again, and went pale immediately, his head hunching down and shoulders dropping in a flinch. “That said. If there were such a thing as a dimensional anomaly…my professional opinion is that its residual signature might look like that.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNGFmZjllZGQyOTQ0MzFhYThhY2NmN2NkNWFiZGEz">The Guard Captain wasn’t interested in the theory. “How much danger is the city in?”</p>
<p class="cnNkYWIyYmQ5ODdjYTQ1MjM4NTQwNzk2MjczMzAxZTVk">“I have no idea, sir.”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDU4ZGUxNjRhODRhZDhhNDdhMjc1OWZhMjU0YWU1">“That isn’t a helpful response, Marcus.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMmVlMWZlM2I4NTQwMWFiMmE4YjA2OTg1Y2ZjNGUy">“It’s stable,” Vivi interjected. “I’m fairly certain it’s repairing itself.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NTIyMDM5YjhhYTQ4MDc5ZWE0ZGM2ZmQxMWZhOTQ3">They both turned to her.</p>
<p class="cnM4MmFiYzI3NGNlNzRkM2I4ZmZiN2ViYjU3ZmU3NzZk">“How can you even <em>begin </em>deciphering that mess?” Marcus asked. “It’s blinding.”</p>
<p class="cnNjYzU4NzhhZWJiMTQyN2NiZjEyODlhMDhkYTVmMGYx">Vivi paused. Blinding? How so? “It’s definitely stable, and I can confirm that the cracks are healing.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMjYzMjFjMzUzZDQ1Yzg4ZTc4NzJhOGZkOWRhNTg0">“How much danger is the city in?” the Guard Captain repeated, but at her, this time. “If you would be so kind as to help, Lady Adventurer.”</p>
<p class="cnMxN2JiNDM4Y2ZlMzRmYWY5NmM2N2Q5ZTllMmUyZGM2">She hesitated, and didn’t quite answer. “I think someone tried to open a gateway.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNGY4YTFiMjZhOTQ5NDQ4ZTlmMGQwMjFkYjg4ODgw">“A gateway?”</p>
<p class="cnMyMzlhYzc3Zjc2ZDRiZGZhYzkzMjE1NTEzMTdlOTcw">“Someone or something tried to punch a hole through. They failed. All of that,” she gestured at the sky, “is someone trying to throw a rock through a window, but there wasn’t enough force. In fact, I think it would have taken an order of magnitude more.” She glanced at the center of the fracture. “It’s definitely repairing. But slowly. It’ll linger for months. Dimensional boundaries are stable and self-regulating? Interesting.”</p>
<p class="cnNiYWE5MThjYzBmZDQwNWY5NjA2NTc3NjY3YmU3ZDBh">The Guard Captain didn’t seem ‘interested’ in the event, and what insights Vivi was gleaning about this unusual branch of magic. “The city is in no danger?” he asked to confirm.</p>
<p class="cnMwNmQxZWViNzQyMjQyYTM5OTc1NzAyMzI1YWIxZDc1">“It’s impossible to say. And also impossible to say what would happen if a gate <em>did </em>form.” She shrugged. “I’m growing more certain by the moment that there’s no active threat though.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNWE1OWIyMDliNjQ0YTRiNTYxM2UwYjAyZTYzOWZl">“That’s more than just about any mage in the kingdom could give,” Marcus said, “assuming you haven’t invented everything you’ve said to sound intelligent.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNDQ0NjNiMjI4MTQ2Yzk4Njk4ZDJiOTQyYmJmYTQ1">“Marcus,” the Guard Captain reprimanded, surprised.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmE5Y2IxMmZlZDRmZDZiOWFhYjFlMjAzM2M4NTU5">“I don’t think she did, for the record,” Marcus said. “It’s just a bit unbelievable. Who <em>are</em> you? With all due respect, Lady Adventurer.”</p>
<p class="cnMyOWY3MTkxMmMyNzQyMzZhNDViMDUzNTRkN2UwN2Zi">Vivi eyed him and didn’t answer. She turned to the Guard Captain. “I only came to make you aware of the situation. Do you have means of contacting Meridian?”</p>
<p class="cnNlNGY4ODkwOTdhNTRkMzhhYzQ3ZTA0Nzk3YWEwMzM0">“Meridian?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZmVhNGU4ZmQ3MzQ2MGViZjc4YTQ5YjE0YzNjMjhm">“The Institute. You’ll probably want to get the mages there to study it.” She flicked her eyes up, attention lingering briefly. It really was fascinating, no matter how much it had panicked her at the start. “I’ll get in contact myself, once I arrive in person.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTAxZWRlZWY0NzRlNTI4ZDRiODBlOTZjYjZlNTg1">“We have a scrying mirror,” the Guard Captain said. “You’re leaving the city soon?”</p>
<p class="cnMwODFhZjIxMTljMzRjNTBhYjA3Yzk0NGE3ZmYzY2Qw">“Tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p class="cnMxOTQzZjgyMGYxMjRmN2M5MTMzNjc0NzA4NmNiNjg1">The Guard Captain seemed to have mixed emotions on that revelation, but he didn’t voice them. “I see. Could you help form the preliminary report with Marcus, for the Institute’s perusal? You’ve done our city a great service for a second time, Lady Adventurer.” He bowed deeply, catching her off guard.</p>
<p class="cnMzNWM3YjI5YjgyOTRiNDZhNDdmNTUyMjY2YjllZmQ0">She found herself miffed. It wasn’t like she could say <em>no</em>, after being asked so politely.</p>
<p class="cnNlMTBhYTg2ODhiYzQwYWFhNmU2NzdkMzZjMDY1MTFi">What a headache, though. She had just wanted to enjoy the festival.</p>

## Chapter 15: 15 - Apprenticeship


                <p class="cnNkZGFiNzY0ODM3ZjQwZmVhYmY5NDdiZmMwMzczNDRl">It was well past midnight when Vivi retired. Thanks to the festival, finding an inn with a free room turned out to be an ordeal, but at least the more expensive ones weren’t fully booked—and she had enough coin to convince her way in.</p>
<p class="cnMxMjA0MTY0YzAxZTQ5MmVhY2M5YzVmYTQxNTk1YTIx">She discovered the wonders of magic for a second time as she prepared for bed. Washing up and drying was as simple as casting a few spells. Her hair handled the magical wash remarkably well too, coming out straight and glossy without need for brushing. That alone made [Tidy] a contender for her second-favorite spell.</p>
<p class="cnMxNGRlZDA5MDZlOTQ3N2NiNzYyMGVmN2E0NzM2ZGQw">It even worked for brushing her teeth. She thought. It left her mouth feeling clean afterward, at least, but she might prefer finding toothpaste. She felt weird not going through her usual hygienic routine. Did this world even <em>have</em> toothpaste?</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDlmNzJiYmQ3ZTQ4ZTRiMTNkMmQzZmMwZDg2OTgy">After the events of the day, she was quick to pass out. She’d been feeling the tug of tiredness for hours now, and while it was easier to ignore in this body than her previous, she suspected that despite all her levels she would want sleep every night. Levels didn’t immunize her against basic needs, though if she needed to, she could probably ignore them for quite a while.</p>
<p class="cnNiNDRhNDA0OGE0YzRhZDRhNzM2OThiNDE0YTY0NTQ1">Having horns changed the bedtime dynamic. If she hadn’t preferred sleeping on her back rather than her side or stomach, it might have been a rather annoying change in her physiology. As it was, the protrusions didn’t bother her. She slept fine.</p>
<p class="cnNkNzJiOTU3YzE4MzRjMzI5Y2NlNDcyNTQyYTljZTcw">A magical timepiece woke her on the nine o’clock bell. She groggily rolled around and almost fell back asleep before forcing herself to her feet with disheveled hair, which she cured with another [Tidy]. Yes, definitely one of her favorites.</p>
<p class="cnMwMjc1MGZmMDM2ZDQ1ODhhODYxM2YwNjMzM2E5NDY2">She had two errands to run before heading for the Convoy, the colloquial term for the train system in this world. Both were at the guardhouse, so she [Blinked] there after a quick breakfast.</p>
<p class="cnMwNWM5MWQ2MzFiYzRhNGU5MWUzM2FkNzQxOTlmMDIw">The supply requisition had gone through, so Vivi had the materials needed to renew and improve the enchantments securing the two criminals, who had thankfully not escaped. They were being watched over by a man with a green badge on his shoulder, now. Orichalcum rank. Vivi doubted anyone would be wiggling away from <em>that </em>kind of surveillance, especially with the other protections layered in. <em>And </em>a set of massive debuffs, which she recast on the two prisoners before leaving.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZjFkMzJhOWYzOTQ2NjNiNzY5MjZlMmE1ZjBkM2Y1">Next, she found the Guard Captain. Their conversation was brief. He’d gotten in contact with the Institute, and apparently they were extremely<em> </em>interested in her thanks to the ‘intriguing observations’ and ‘novel mana current diagrams’ she had made, which Marcus had relayed in conjunction with her the night before. Apparently they wished badly to discuss the topic via scrying table, and had impressed the fact on the Guard Captain. But Vivi declined and left shortly, and he didn’t try to stop her, perhaps sensing that between annoying the Institute and annoying her, the former was far more preferable. She refused to get mixed up further in the city’s business.</p>
<p class="cnM0M2U5NzMzYzIwNzRkODU5YTViZGZmOGU3YWI2Mzcz">Of course, she would be following up herself on the potential danger of the dimensional anomaly when she arrived in Meridian, and would be checking in on Prismarche with [Greater Warp], but there wasn’t much else to do since the anomaly seemed stable and was slowly healing itself.</p>
<p class="cnNmZjBiMDVmMGU4OTRmYjZiZjg5ODkzZDQ0NjAzYjNm">The Institute—the world’s nexus of magical knowledge—would be able to make more headway researching it anyway. Vivisari was a genius with magic, but mostly in regard to practical applications. She’d been able to sense the anomaly and decipher the mana currents to categorize it, but anything beyond that, she didn’t know where to begin. The problem was too complex. Maybe if she could see such magic cast in real-time, she could reverse-engineer it.</p>
<p class="cnNlZDJjNDdmN2VlZTRlYTc5ZTVhMDBiY2IyZjA0MWQ1">Loose ends tied up, she went and found Saffra at the Adventurer’s Guild.</p>
<p class="cnNkZTBmOTE3MTUyZjRiNTdiYzhiMjQ3ODcyY2MyYjZi">The redheaded catgirl was slouched over at one of the tables on the far end of the open lobby, her head in both hands. Her tail and ears were both drooping.</p>
<p class="cnNhNjAwYTE4MDllNzQ2NGFiNTJhZTgwMmRiM2Q0YWZk">Vivi frowned. Had something happened?</p>
<p class="cnM0MWI5MDZjMjJiZjQ5ZTQ5ZThjYTllODdmNGYxOGZk">“What is it?” she asked as she walked over to the teenager.</p>
<p class="cnM4NDA4MzczMTRhMzQwNmFiNmI1YjliMTAyOTg5Njgz">Saffra jumped. She’d been so lost in thought she hadn’t heard her. She gaped at Vivi. “Did you—did you change your mind?” she blurted out. A flush immediately colored her cheeks. “I mean, i-is the plan the same?”</p>
<p class="cnNjOGUxYjRmMWRmNjRiY2RhOGZkODVhYzJhOTljMTc2">Vivi raised an eyebrow. Was <em>that</em> what she’d been stewing over?</p>
<p class="cnNkY2Y1MjU5MDlmOTQ5NTQ5YzdkNDAyNDgyOTJjNWEw">“I had business to handle, but it’s taken care of. I’m ready to leave. You’ve packed?” Vivi’s eyes flicked to the brown rucksack to her side. “It’s not an issue, leaving so quickly?”</p>
<p class="cnM2OTU0ZDYzMTIzMTQwYzFhY2UzZmZiMTk2ZjM4Mjhk">“No. No issue. I’m ready.” She bolted to her feet and scooped up her pack, like if she didn’t hurry she risked the whole arrangement falling through.</p>
<p class="cnM5Nzg5ZmMzMmU0NDQ1ZDk5OTFmM2Y5MmNkZGMyZTI5">Vivi nodded, turned, and headed for the door. She had no business in the Adventurer’s Guild, nor had she made any contacts she needed to say goodbye to. She’d deliberately been avoiding getting entangled in Prismarche, in fact, so it was impressive that she’d been involved in no less than four debacles.</p>
<p class="cnNkYmUzYWI5YWM4MjQ5OWM4N2E4MDg2NWViN2QzZjlj">The pair of them didn’t make it through more than a minute of walking through Prismarche’s streets before Saffra blurted out, “Can I ask <em>why</em>, at least?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNGZiMTVmYTNhYjRjZWViYjhiZDIxYmI5ZjFhNTRm">“Why what?”</p>
<p class="cnM0YTYxNTliOWExMzRjZjA4M2E2OGMxNTIwYTBhMTg2">“Why me? You weren’t supposed to say yes!”</p>
<p class="cnMxZjk4YjdjYmU5NDQ2YTg4MDhhMWQ3ZWM0Yjk4OGVm">“I wasn’t?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MGI3MmI3MzFlMTQ3OTY4Y2ViYTk5OTlhZGY5ZGRl">“Not that—I don’t mean—it just doesn’t make sense.”</p>
<p class="cnM0Zjg3ODMzYTA4ZDQ5NGU4MGRmYzY2NWIyMTZlYTY1">“It makes sense to me.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDdiNDYyNmEwZTRkNDVhN2QxZDI0ZDM4ODA5MjY5">“But why?”</p>
<p class="cnNhODFkOTQ2MDY3MzQyZDhhMTBhOTVjYWFlNjUzYjY1">Vivi mulled over her response. She did have her reasons, but explaining them to Saffra probably wouldn’t go over well. To some degree, it was protectiveness and sympathy, and she doubted Saffra wanted to hear that.</p>
<p class="cnMwYjBjOTE3ZjY1NzQ2NWZhMWNjN2U1YjQ3YmY1ZjM0">“Because you’re the kind of person I want to teach,” Vivi said, and it was the unblemished, if not full, truth. If she could pass down some of her fortune, Saffra would make a great recipient. Her heart was undeniably in the right place—she seemed like a good person. What better trait could there be for an apprentice? “Not that I expect I’ll be good at it,” Vivi amended.</p>
<p class="cnNmNThmOTFhM2E0ZTRiODQ4MWVlYzIyZjc2ZTliYWMy">Saffra seemed to struggle through that response as they walked. In the end, she didn’t press. “You said you were ‘occupied’ for a long time. Several decades. And that you need a guide and helper you can trust. What did you mean by that?”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTVkYWM3YTg0NDQ4MTY4MjZiZGMyMGExYzM4YmQ2">She noted how Saffra didn’t ask <em>what</em> she had been busy with. Maybe she didn’t want to push her luck by prying.</p>
<p class="cnMwZjc0YjZmZDY3ZDRjYmNiOTNlM2U0ZmY4M2U1ZDRi">“Things have changed since I’ve last mingled with society. I’ve forgotten a lot. Since I don’t want to draw too much attention, it’s convenient to have someone who I can ask questions of.”</p><span class="cmIzNWQ0ZmE1MWE2OTRjNTk4OWY3NDk3ZTZkMjMxNmRk"><br>This story originates from Royal Road. Ensure the author gets the support they deserve by reading it there.<br></span>
<p class="cnMzNTg1MzlmYzJlZDRmYWRiYThlN2FjZGRhYjBmMDUy">“Questions? That’s it?” She could feel Saffra giving her an extremely dubious look. “Also, you’ve been <em>avoiding</em> attention?”</p>
<p class="cnNjZjRiYWM5NTcyZTRjY2VhNTA4NDY5OTU2YWNlM2E4">“I haven’t been doing a great job, I know.”</p>
<p class="cnNhYjdmNjIxNmE4MTQ1OWI4MDliOWRjOWY0YmE2MjU5">She almost added that Saffra was at fault for that, with the biggest debacle being the Morningstars, but decided even allusions to that event were best avoided.</p>
<p class="cnNjNGY0NjI0NzUwNjQ1YzQ5NDZhNzIzODg3Zjk5NTli">“More than just answering questions, though, tell me when I’m doing something strange. Especially if it’s common sense, or a lapse in etiquette, or such. Point out the obvious. There’s no need to be overly respectful.” She spared a sideways look at the girl. “I don’t think respect is your strong suit, anyway.”</p>
<p class="cnM5OWY0NWI1NTk0OTQ4MTNhMjBhNWYyNDNhODgzNmI3">Saffra sniffed. “I could call you Mistress Vivienne if I was absolutely forced to,” she joked. “But I’m not sure about more than that.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MmZjZGYyZTRjMjRlOTViMGEwYzFmYjVkZmJjZmRm">She immediately snuck a worried look out of the corner of her eye to check how Vivi interpreted the words. She was definitely still nervous around her, and Vivi didn’t think that would change for a while. They <em>were </em>strangers, and she could tell Saffra trusted slowly.</p>
<p class="cnMwMmRhMDg0NDA5ZDQxZTNhYzgyZTUxYmUwOTA4MTZi">“Definitely don’t call me ‘Mistress’,” Vivi said, grimacing at the idea. “Vivi is fine.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNzAzOGJjMjNjZjQ3ZTg5MjBkZGU5MmFjNmZmYjE2">The idea of being given that title didn’t sit right with her because, while she wasn’t a fraud in the literal sense, since Vivisari’s magical knowledge and talent had been packed into her head and thus she <em>did </em>have the credentials to teach a young mage, she nevertheless felt like she would be deceiving Saffra. Being called ‘Mistress’ as if she was some wizened sage didn’t appeal to her for a number of reasons.</p>
<p class="cnNhZjg2ZWViYjg0MzQ4ZDBhOWY3ODQ3OTkyZjAxM2Zj">“So that we understand each other,” Vivi continued, “what are you expecting out of an apprenticeship? Practically speaking.”</p>
<p class="cnM2ODM2MDJhMTJlMTQ2Y2U5ZTJmNDI2ZWM0NWUyZTdj">Saffra hesitated. “Well, the apprenticeship itself, of course,” she started.</p>
<p class="cnMzNjQwM2Y5M2QyZTQ4YzFhY2QyMmQ1NzM2ZGE2YTQ5">Vivi tilted her head. She could tell she had missed something. Saffra sensed it too.</p>
<p class="cnMxOTYyZmY5ZGRjZjRjYmM5ZmZhODc2NTE1ZTA0YzRk">“The apprenticeship. Um. The status.”</p>
<p class="cnM5MWYzYjRhMDJjZjQ3YTFiNjQwODc3NGEzYmE3NWNj">“The status?”</p>
<p class="cnM2ZDA5Nzc4YjlmMTQyODhhNTY2Y2ExYzAxYTliY2Nm">“For…apprenticeship,” she said somewhat dumbly. Disoriented for a moment, she asked, “Is this one of those things you mentioned?”</p>
<p class="cnMxYTk5MjY0MTBlMDRkZWU5MjgxYTUxNWU1OGQ0Mjc5">“Always assume it is. I told you not to be afraid of stating the obvious.”</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTRkYTY2OTk0OTQ4ZmJhOTZiMDZmMWZmNWIyZTJj">Saffra seemed to perk up at that, funny enough. Maybe because she was happy she could help meaningfully with something as simple as common knowledge.</p>
<p class="cnNjZTUyNmVkNTA5NTQ1NTk5MzUxOWNkMTI4ZDg4OTU2">“When someone takes an apprentice of a lower level and similar enough class, the apprentice gets an apprenticeship status. A buff. It boosts experience gain, and is stronger the bigger the gap between master and apprentice.” She came to an abrupt stop, and Vivi had to do the same. Saffra looked deeply worried, for some reason. “Wait. If you didn’t know about that, then...?”</p>
<p class="cnNjZThhN2I2NjJiZTQxZWNhMDI5YjRmODk3MGQzN2Fk">“You don’t need to keep asking if I’m going to change my mind. I expect I’m going to be busy, but I <em>will </em>set time aside to help you where I can. And in the worst case, I’ll arrange other lessons for you. I have contacts, if need be.”</p>
<p class="cnNkOTk1ODdhZGQ2NDRmZWI5YzgzOTNiYzIxNWUzZjM1">Well, maybe. She could make new ones if nothing else.</p>
<p class="cnNjZDYxYzFhMTAyZjQxMzZhZDZjOGQwOTg2ODY3MDJl">“Right.” Saffra hurried back forward, and their pace resumed. She was flushing slightly, embarrassed at her repeated shows of insecurity.</p>
<p class="cnM5MjY0MzliMmM1MTQ2M2FiYTUwYmFhNjA1OWRkZDk5">“It’s an interesting mechanic,” Vivi said. “The apprenticeship. It has a number of implications, someone of a high level always being able to pass down their legacy.”</p>
<p class="cnMyMWIxNmI5ZDA5MzQ1YjQ4NTdhZGE2YjJjOWQzN2Qy">Saffra had a less generous interpretation. “Means even an idiot can fly through the levels, as long as her family is rich enough,” she muttered.</p>
<p class="cnNkYzIwMjdjYTVkNDRlNGM5ODE0ZjNiYTk3ZjViZTY0">Vivi raised an eyebrow. That seemed targeted toward a specific person, but she didn’t mention it. “Setting that aside, you didn’t answer. What else, practically speaking, are you expecting from this?”</p>
<p class="cnNjZGJmMjllZTBkYjQwY2NiZTI4MDg0ODBmNzQ1ZTk3">Saffra chewed on her lip as they trekked through the busy streets. She had to dip out of the way to avoid hitting passersby, scurrying forward to catch back up. Vivi realized people were making space for her as she walked. She hadn’t even been paying much attention to the crowd, but they split for her as if by instinct. Huh.</p>
<p class="cnMxMmQwY2MwNWVhYTQxZmRiZjVhMWFlM2I5NGI2ZWNi">“I guess…personal spell coaching is the biggest thing? Having someone show a spell over and over and telling me what I’m doing wrong is<em> </em>night and day from stumbling through it myself. But also all the other stuff, I guess. Mana control exercises, a routine, and, just, advice on how <em>you </em>reached such a high level?”</p>
<p class="cnMyODg3OTc0Yjc3NzQ5Y2E5ZGYyNTM0ZGQwMTZhYTRl">“My case isn’t something to model after. Which is why I don’t think I’ll be the best teacher.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNTUyMWUwYzZkOTRlNDRhNWQ5YjhhMDg5OWNjODQy">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="cnNkMDdjNTNjNDZjNDQ3MDRiZTU1MGMzYjZkNzIwMmM1">It was a thorny question to answer without sounding arrogant. But she guessed she would have to. “A person can’t reasonably compare their progress to mine. I can’t and shouldn’t be imitated.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNTkyZTVlMzAxZDQ3MTFhNmQxNGRiMGJkMjgwMGFl">Saffra didn’t give her a weird look for that explanation. In fact, she nodded vigorously. “Geniuses,” she said. “I kind of hate them, but they exist, and you have to deal with it.” She stiffened, panicking slightly. “Not that I hate <em>you</em>, um, I was just saying—”</p>
<p class="cnMyNzdhMGYyMWM5NDRhYjA5ZDgwZGQwOTI0OTZkNGZj">“You don’t need to be so nervous around me,” Vivi said, amused. “But yes, I agree, geniuses are frustrating. Effort matters too though. Maybe more. The world is full of unrealized talent. Just do your best.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNzZlZTE0MGJhNTQyZDViNDA1NjY4MTFlNTdlODQ0">A platitude, some would say, but she stood by it. This was one of the few topics she could speak on with a reasonable amount of wisdom. While ‘rank one in an extremely popular skill-based video game’ wasn’t the most impressive credential in the world, she <em>did </em>have experience with the concept of genius versus hard work.</p>
<p class="cnMxMzcwYzZjZGFiYTQ2ZjM4OTI5YmU4MzJlOTRkNGY0">In the end, the peak talents—the absolute best of the best—of any field had some ratio of genius, hard work, and luck. Almost none completely lacked in any of those categories.</p>
<p class="cnMxODA2NWQ1ODNlMzRkYjJiY2EzMWIxYTEzNjY2ZmQ1">For her, she had leaned heavily on the ‘pour an absurd number of hours in’ method of improvement, but she had undoubtedly been blessed in both luck and natural skill too. She’d picked up the game much faster than other people, without initially meaning to.</p>
<p class="cnNlODQ0MTgyOTQ1MDRiYmFiNjFjYWNmMTRmYzJlYjcy">“As for demonstrating spells, suggesting exercises, and creating a routine.” Vivi hummed. “The first and second, I can manage. The third, I might not be the best source on.”</p>
<p class="cnNhOTdjMTk1Yjc5YjRiNzk4NjFlYmFhNzEzOGVmNDVl">“The first is the most important,” Saffra assured her. “Especially if you can demonstrate some, you know, <em>unique </em>spell designs for me?”</p>
<p class="cnM5OTEwYzRhY2MwMTQ1YjRiYjk3YjdiYjA3ODRlMTE1">“Meaning?”</p>
<p class="cnMwMzJjMWIyZjNlYzRiMWU5OGNmYzEwOWM2ODdmMWMx">“Even in the Institute, the best<em> </em>designs were locked away. Or kept inside guilds or families. Anything available to the public was…not the best. I’ve made some improvements on the designs myself, but I can only do so much. I’m no good at spell architecture.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNDVjMDBhMGUyNjQwZTFhMjkwMjZjMDdiMGFjYWY3">“The Institute. You did mention attending. What happened?”</p>
<p class="cnM5OGJiMzI2ZDc4ZTQ3NDM4NzQ5NTYyM2VhZTc1OTVl">Saffra grimaced. “Just…stuff, you know…”</p>
<p class="cnMwNDdjZWZjMmVlMzQzMzM5NDk1M2Y0NTNmYmQ0MDkx">Vivi raised an eyebrow, and while Saffra squirmed, she didn’t volunteer anything more. But also didn’t offer up a lie, which Vivi appreciated.</p>
<p class="cnMwOWUwNDBkZDUyMjQ1MTQ4ZDIyNWEyYjUwMTQ2YTRm">“We’re headed to Meridian, so you’re aware,” Vivi told her.</p>
<p class="cnNmNjQ5NTliYjUwMjQyYWM4ODk3NjNmMTY3MzJhZjZh">Saffra slammed to a stop. “We are?” she asked with such utter dismay that Vivi was concerned, all of a sudden.</p>
<p class="cnM0OTljN2U1MGI4NTRiN2FiZDJkMDY3MWM2ODFjNzIy">“Is that a problem?”</p>
<p class="cnNlMzdjMTE4MjY4YjQ0NDRiOTdlYWMwMjY5ZDBkZjE2">The distraught expression went nowhere, but finally she wiped her face clear and strode forward. “N-No, that’s fine.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NmM1OTZiNjM2OTQ1Y2RiNjdlNzMzNDA0NDgyZWM4">Clearly<em> </em>a lie, but the sort anybody would give. It wasn’t ‘fine’, but it was fine. She would deal with it.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZGMxNzczZjgwNjQxMWY5NGY0ZWE4Y2QzZmUzNjlm">Vivi pursed her lips, wondering if she needed to press. She decided she could find out more later, once Saffra was comfortable with her. It was obviously a touchy topic.</p>
<p class="cnM5MWRjNjVlOTQxNTRhYTZiMTdjOTc4MzIyMDk2ODZh">What trouble had she gotten into at the Institute? And it had to be trouble. Saffra seemed to be a magnet for that, based on her impression of the girl.</p>
<p class="cnNkZGY0NTZmNmM0YTQ5YTliMWJiM2JmMmYyNDIyMDlj">Which reminded Vivi of something. “Oh, right. Here. Take this, just in case.”</p>
<p class="cnMwYTZlMWJhODE3ZTQ5ZDA5MjJhYmU0OGQ4MGQ0ZDVj">Saffra blinked as Vivi removed a healing potion from her inventory and handed it to her. Her brow furrowed as she looked at it.</p>
<p class="cnNkMmM0ZDM3ZjA0ZTRmM2E4NWQwYzU4OGQ5YWFlMDcy">“I can’t [Inspect] it. It’s too high level.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMTIxMDk4NzdjZDRlYjNiNzI2MTA0OGUyOWI0M2U5">[Inspect]. The built-in skill that identified an item’s characteristics and spat out information. In the game, there had been various criteria determining how much a person could see, the primary ones being level and crafting ability. Alchemists could naturally identify herbs and potions better than most people, for example.</p>
<p class="cnM3Y2VjMzI5NTZkZDQ4NGQ4ZjRiMDhkY2U4MmFhYmUy">For her, the screen read:</p>
<p class="cnNjZjJkYTljMmFmZTRmOTU5N2VkMGUxZDAyMjVmNTEx">***</p>
<p class="cnNlMzU3YTgzNzk2ODRjYTdhOGQ1Zjk2Yzk4NjZkMDhi">Phoenix Blood Elixir</p>
<p class="cnM5YjllN2U2ODg4ZDQ0MGY4ODg1MTc0NjFiYTc2ZmI5">Lv. 2000</p>
<p class="cnNiNzNjZWI2MGQyMDQzZGU5Njk1ODBiMGRmZDc5MTc0">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="cnM0MmJlZTg3NGI0OTQyMThiMDdiY2NhMzVjM2E5MTI2">A miraculous healing concoction derived from the blood of a phoenix and numerous divine-grade herbs and catalysts. Capable of healing nearly all lethal wounds and purging the vast majority of toxins and curses for entities up to level 2000.</p>
<p class="cnNjNWM2OTYyYzJhMTQ0NTRiZTg1Y2MyZjZlOWM1NTc1">***</p>
<p class="cnM3NDljNTRmOTQwZDRlYzVhM2ViMWVhY2ExMWE4N2Fi">“It’s strong,” Vivi said. “You’ll probably need to dilute it before drinking. By a lot. I don’t think it would be toxic, exactly, if you drank it straight, but it’s a bit…beyond your level. Best to be safe.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMmJiZjQyZWVjZjRlYmJhZjEyMDQ5MmUwOGI4N2Nm">“Uh huh,” Saffra said skeptically. “Just a little bit.” She stiffened, remembering she’d forgotten something. “But, um, thank you, of course.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNWEwZmIwMDhiYjRkYTI4MDI4YTNiYTY5Nzk4MTlh">“It’s for if something happens and I’m not there to help. Take one of these too.”</p>
<p class="cnMwY2NmMDY1MjM0ZTQyNWZiZjcyYjZjZWU5Nzg1NDRj">She gave her a mana potion next. She had extras, and while they were valuable even by her standards, she was hardly going to hoard them when they might save the girl’s life. Saffra seemed to attract trouble, and traveling with Vivi would probably worsen that issue.</p>
<p class="cnNlOTYzY2Y5MzA5YjQ0Y2ZiYjE1NjYwNGVlNDBhM2Ew">Saffra took the potion with an even more impressed look at the blue liquid inside, and said another thank you.</p>
<p class="cnM4N2RiNzI3Mzc5ZjRkNDI5YTY4NGMyYjRmM2MzYTI0">A minute later, they’d arrived at the train station.</p>

## Chapter 16: 16 - The Convoy


                <p class="cnMyYjNhZWEyNTJlMzQ0MzNhYTVhZDJiOTA0NDY5ZDcw">While this world had rail travel, people hardly used it for daily commuting. Nor was the Convoy as widespread as the public transit systems Vivi knew back home. The Convoy linked cities throughout the continent, but only major ones, and was for transporting goods as much as people. The train having already arrived, she saw workers hauling crates away, hurrying to meet the tight schedule.</p>
<p class="cnNlM2RlZTYwNWQ1NTQzNTNhODAzMWUzYmViY2FlYjE1">Her turn at the ticket booth arrived, and she stepped up. A pimply-faced boy no older than sixteen greeted her. A brief exchange followed in which Vivi questioned him on the different types of passage.</p>
<p class="cnMxODQyZjY4ODM5NTRlM2Q4NDMyZTM1ZmJhNTFkNjE0">Unsurprisingly, the lowest tier was an economy ticket where commoners could pack in for an affordable ride—relatively speaking—between cities. According to him, it was an especially good value today since they would be light on passengers. Everyone would be able to stretch their legs. Most people in Prismarche were staying for the full festival, not leaving after the first day.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZGE3MDY0YWU0YTQ0ODE4YjhiZjE5ZWM0YjVjMTM3">Higher up was an equivalent to business class, then first class, and finally something he called ‘access to the Lounge’, which he explained only after being pressed.</p>
<p class="cnM2Y2YxYWVkNTg3ZjRkMjg4OTUwMjgxYzcyYTc3OGI4">For the first time in her life, she had enough money to not have to worry about wasting it, and the train ride would be over twelve hours. Why not make the trip in comfort? She had coin to spare.</p>
<p class="cnMwYWFmYTg5OWUxNjQwYWE5OGEzODdmNTg1NWFjMzY0">The cost was two mithril per leg. She would have to pay a similar fee for the next chunk of distance too.</p>
<p class="cnMxNTk5NjcxZWMwNzQ2OGJiMTkyNTkxYTI4MDg1YTJl">How valuable was two mithril, in terms she could understand? Since all coins traded at a ten-to-one ratio—though the different denominations weren’t of a uniform size—that meant twenty gold coins.</p>
<p class="cnNhZjA2ZmRlZmEyODQ5YWY5MmMxMjVmZjk3NGU2M2Qy">Gold was valuable. Everyone knew that. But some people didn’t realize how valuable. Those standard-size ingots that weighed under thirty pounds were worth well over a million dollars. Learning that, Vivi had gone on an internet crawl out of curiosity. A shocking tidbit was that a standard quarter, if made of pure gold, would be worth more than a thousand dollars. For that tiny bit of metal.</p>
<p class="cnNlN2MxNWMxOGE4NTQyY2E4YmI4MjhiZWFkYTUyYmEx">Seeing how Seven Cataclysms’ gold coins were roughly twice the size of a quarter, meaning four times the volume, that meant four thousand dollars each—probably more.</p>
<p class="cnMxYmZlOTQ4OTNkZTQ4MjNhZGUyMTNiMDY3ZTFlZGYz">Of course, she had no idea if these coins were pure gold. They were probably mixed with some<em> </em>ratio of other metals, because thanks to its softness, pure gold made for poor coinage. And trying to compare purchasing power across time periods, much less worlds, didn’t make sense. She knew that without a degree in economics.</p>
<p class="cnM4OWJjOTE3YWYxZTRkYjQ5MGFhMTBjYjY4OThiMjQ5">Still. If she did some math? Two mithril, equaling twenty large gold coins, each of which was worth roughly four grand?</p>
<p class="cnMxMzNmOTFkY2I2ODQ5MjJhM2M2MTc0YzBiNWExNGMx">Eighty thousand dollars?</p>
<p class="cnMwNGY2Nzg2YjIxZTQwYzBiZmE4MGI1MzdmYzhmYmI1">For a <em>train ride</em>? Per ticket, per leg of the trip.</p>
<p class="cnNlYTA5MDg0NGFkODRhNjBhZTFmMzk0M2YxY2M5ZDY0">She blanched, but she’d already handed over the coins. She’d done the calculations while walking away.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjIxNzJmZDhjODRjOTlhZWQ4ZGYwY2YxMWU3N2Zj">It explained why Saffra had a horrified look on her face. “You bought one for <em>me</em>? Why?”</p>
<p class="cnMyMmQwZGYyYTZhOTRiNzg5OTcwMDM3YjdhYWE0Zjhk">Vivi frowned. If the girl had taken the perspective that she shouldn’t have wasted the money on either of them, that would have been fair. But if she had bought one for herself, why wouldn’t Saffra deserve a comfortable ride too?</p>
<p class="cnMyYjEyNTlhYWJlYzQ1NzViNTI3NmM5NWEyYWJjOWZi">“Coin isn’t an issue,” Vivi said dismissively, and that was the truth of the matter, even if her frugal half paled at what she’d done. “Also, that reminds me.” She pulled out a pouch filled with forty mithril, mentally staggering as she realized just how much money that was. “Your half.” She would pass over the entire bounty, but suspected Saffra would protest.</p>
<p class="cnNjMDZkZGU0NTAzZTQzNjJhMGU1MGFmMzk2ZmEzMjk4">Saffra took the bag with a furrowed brow, untied the string, and peeked in. She stiffened at what she saw.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzE3ZmFkOTU2YzRkOGU4MjBkYjAyNTcxOTkyZGUz">“My half of what?” she asked, suddenly tense.</p>
<p class="cnMzYjY5ZjQzYmM4NzQwNTBhZThiNmRhMmNjMTI4M2I5">“Those two had bounties on them.”</p>
<p class="cnNiN2QxZTQyZGEzNzQ5NjI5YTllOGFkNGIzMjM3ZWI4">Vivi knew she’d done something wrong by how Saffra froze, clamped the bag shut, and swiveled her head to Vivi.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDU2MThlNGMxMzQxZjhhZGFlMmZmY2E4MWRiYjNh">“So why are you giving me half?” she snapped, eyes wide, her posture panicked. “I almost got myself <em>killed</em>. And Allen too. I didn’t help <em>at all.</em>”</p>
<p class="cnM5OGMwNjMzY2E4ODQ3MjFiMjc3ODk4MTk4Y2QwZWVi">“You were the one who—” Vivi started.</p>
<p class="cnMwZGZkZmNiNzAyNDQzMWI4Zjc3ZWIxNzI0ZmM3YWM2">“I wasn’t careful enough. I didn’t take the precautions I should’ve, and in the end I sat there useless and was saved by a miracle no one in their right mind could have expected. Half? Why would I get half?” She shoved the bag toward Vivi. “Take it. Take it back. I don’t want it!”</p>
<p class="cnM1OWEyODEwMzc4ZjQ0MDhiODA4NGFmYTUwNGE5MzI0">Vivi took the pouch, if only because she sensed that now wasn’t the time to argue the point. Saffra was shaking slightly, and seemed ready to sprint away.</p>
<p class="cnNhMmZkMzQ1M2U3YzQxN2M4NjczMjdlYTUzNzE5Njcz">Vivi wasn’t good with people, and here was the evidence. She had done something callous without meaning to. Far from a first in her life.</p>
<p class="cnNhYzUyMGY0NGE0NDQ1YmJhOGRjZDBlNjBjNzBhN2Fl">She had also vastly overestimated how much Saffra had ‘bounced back’ from the events of the prior day. In retrospect, she was a massive idiot. Being assaulted and nearly captured alive wasn’t something a thirteen-year-old girl ‘got over’ in a single night.</p>
<p class="cnNlYmNjNWE0NTZlZDQ5YmQ4ZjFjODIyYjM4YTRkOWU2">Someone else might have had the right words to smooth things over, but not her. And she’d learned saying nothing was better than digging the hole deeper.</p><span class="cjI1NTFiZmM4ZDg0ZDQyM2JiMjNlMTBmYmU5YTIwOGI4"><br>Unauthorized reproduction: this story has been taken without approval. Report sightings.<br></span>
<p class="cnNhMjYzZWQxM2UzMjRkNzFiNzY1ZDU0OWJiM2NhNWQw">“Sorry,” she offered, if nothing else.</p>
<p class="cnNmMjA3NjVlNWJlOTRmMzhiYWU4ODQ1NjkzZjE4YWQz">Saffra had composed herself by the time they reached their destination, but she was still looking miserable. “I’m sorry too,” she mumbled.</p>
<p class="cnNkYWQxNmZmM2EzODQ5MDBhNjEwYzAzNmRmZGU3NjRl">The Convoy—the train itself—was an impressive sight. It was larger than most trains, at least as she knew them, squat and blocky, layered with armor thick enough to stop a cannonball.</p>
<p class="cnM2MDJkNjkyNWRhYTQ0NDI5ZTUwMDRkODk0ZmFiMGQ1">Which, upon a moment’s reflection, made sense. This vehicle sailed through thousands of miles of monster-infested territory. Seeing how the rail lines spanned to the remote reaches of Prismarche, the Convoy traveled through very <em>dangerous </em>territory too. Her eyes drifted to what looked like gun turrets stationed every few cars. She sensed mana thrumming through the devices. They looked like they could pivot around, and were presumably piloted from beneath. No doubt magical artillery for fending off the worst of the monsters. She wondered what sort of firepower they packed.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZDBjODRhZDkyMDQwMGM4MThiODkwY2RhODI5ZTgw">A man checked their tickets, eyes flicking to the badges on their chests—Vivi wore her gold-rank badge in hopes she wouldn’t automatically be assumed a child—and tore the stub off and handed back the rest.</p>
<p class="cnM5MGU2YTIwZDFkMTRlY2Q4OTZmNWMwZWYyNjJlYWE3">“I hope you ladies have a nice trip,” he said, bowing slightly.</p>
<p class="cnNiYzY2MmIwOGMwYjQyNjRiOTJkNmI1MzAwOTVhZDZm">Vivi sensed a hint of confusion in the words, no doubt thanks to their ranks. A gold and a silver weren’t supposed to board this carriage.</p>
<p class="cnNhOGE1NzRjMzAwZTQ1ZjFhOGI4M2FlOGQzZTE4YWM3">The interior of the Lounge was spacious, but not especially so. Seating arrangements filled the space: plush armchairs clustered together, a communal space where velvet sofas surrounded a table of polished dark wood, and seating at the far end offering a modicum of privacy.</p>
<p class="cnNkZGNhYmYwN2QyYjRiYzNiNTk1ZGNmYjE0MzgyM2Qx">Toward one wall of the car was an elegantly set table with an array of pastries, fruits, and other morsels—a snack table, though that phrase felt too low-class. Two impeccably dressed butlers stood attentively nearby, presumably ready to assist their clients.</p>
<p class="cnMzYWFmYjAxZWY2ZjRlOWJhZmFhZTUxYzdjNGJkZWQw">The Lounge bled wealth. Not that Vivi was experienced enough with ‘high-class’ to know faux material from real, but she was certain this was the real deal. The gleaming wood paneling, the luxurious carpets, the rich upholstery. She felt out of place.</p>
<p class="cnMzNzExOGQyMGI2ZTRhNGE5MTFiNmNhMWM5MjY1NDFi">A tingling of that sixth sense pulled her attention away. Her eyes bore into the walls, past the paneling, and into the metal shell of the car itself. Enchantments. And not weak ones—ones that made the mithril-rank holding cells in Prismarche look like a cage made of tissue paper.</p>
<p class="cnM1OTI5MDNkMWNmMjQ0NGU5MWI4NDc0MWQ3MjhkMDBh">Vivi realized suddenly that the exorbitant cost wasn’t for the luxury of the experience. In fact, all things considered, this was only a bit above what she would expect of a first-class ride. Maybe less, since it wasn’t private.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDIxN2RmZDYyZTRiZjJiMDE1YWViNmI4ODZkY2Rm">No, the price was for safety. This room was so well-defended she doubted even monsters above level one-thousand would have much success piercing the shell. Should something go wrong with the train, anyone inside this carriage would be perfectly defended until help came. Against any reasonable threat, at least.</p>
<p class="cnNkNTFlY2E2MDQyYjQxNGQ5ODE3MGZkOWVlYzc0Mzc2">In the world of Seven Cataclysms, there were plenty of <em>unreasonable</em> threats, monsters that would give even Vivi a—mild, admittedly—run for her money. Such monsters would take apart these defenses with ease. But enchantments of this strength were likely some of the best a person could expect, meant for nobility or other elites.</p>
<p class="cnNkMDNhMWM4MzFhZDRmYzhhZmVmMWNjMTFmNWYzMDJk">That explained why despite the cost, the Lounge was tight-packed. It was a rolling fortress first, a luxury experience second.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZGRmN2Q5Mjg0ZTRkYmU5MWI0YWVlNTBkYzllOGJi">Maybe she’d wasted her money, because she had little need for safety. She supposed for Saffra’s sake, she appreciated it.</p>
<p class="cnM2NTE4MWRlM2Q3NDQ1NTNhYWJkODUwMDc0NGMwZjgy">Regardless, it was the finest travel accommodations she’d ever seen, so she would enjoy herself.</p>
<p class="cnNlMzZlNGQwZGY3MTRmZGU4YjY0ZDBjNDE3OWNhYjgw">Saffra also ogled the Lounge, walking in hesitantly alongside Vivi. Vivi knew she needed to take the lead between them, even though she was feeling awkward too. She belonged in ‘high society’ no more than Saffra.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDA5YjM2YzQyZTRhMjhiN2YxNjRlMjk1MGM0YjU5">Other passengers had boarded already, and they looked every inch the expected image of ‘elite and wealthy’. The only person she’d spoken to with any level of status was the Guard Captain, and while he gave off the air of a noble, he was more so a military man.</p>
<p class="cnMzNTRhMjYxYzAyMTQ5OGQ5MjI0ZTE5YmQ2ZTQ5NDhi">These were real nobility. Five of them relaxed on sofas in the central area, four adults and a child, all male. A maid—a personal one—quietly watched over the group. Their attention was on one man in particular, a round fellow whose suit needed to be tailored yesterday; it strained to hold him in. Based on how everyone hung on his words, he held the highest rank. He gesticulated as he spoke, his voice nasally, and he was obviously enjoying the attention. Vivi couldn’t say why, but she instantly disliked him.</p>
<p class="cnM5NzQwZjA0YjZiNTRhZDI4OTgwN2ZhOTFkZDUzNzdj">The group’s gazes turned to Vivi and Saffra as they walked in, probably because anyone entering the Lounge was of automatic interest. The cost weeded out all but the wealthiest of people. It took a certain sort of individual to pay such an exorbitant fee.</p>
<p class="cnM0YjFlYzE5ZTlhNzQ0NTA4MWJjYTU3NjZkYTc3NDlh">The lead noble’s nose wrinkled during his inspection of them. Vivi wore her usual robes, which, under a constant [Illusion] to hide the fact they were the Vestments of the Voidwalker, were rather plain-looking.</p>
<p class="cnNlOGM4YmViYTdiZTQ0OTVhY2JlZDc2M2Y4MjI5OTkx">Saffra’s outfit revealed her place in the social hierarchy much more blatantly. She had donned her adventuring get-up: practical, well-used gear. Boots, pants, a loose shirt and shawl, a belt with pouches, and a hefty backpack slung over her shoulders. She came off as what the badge on her chest identified her as: a silver-rank adventurer.</p>
<p class="cnM1YjZlYzY1ZDBiYjRjNmY4NmZjZWY4MTdhNjk2MDkx">The nobleman’s lip curled, obviously disapproving of the sight they made, but he kept up a facade of decorum.</p>
<p class="cnM0NWViYTgxMDhiMDQ1MGE4MWU3NTE5MDNmZDUzODk2">“Welcome, ladies. A rare pleasure to see such…unconventional company in this carriage.”</p>
<p class="cnM1Y2ViYjYwZDMzNDRiMjhiMjBkYWUwYTljOTUzYzNk">His tone was fishing—he wanted to know how a silver and a gold, obviously not of noble birth, had afforded a ticket.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZTI0MmMxODk0NTQ5YzQ5NjNkMTEwNWQ0MjE1Yjc4">Vivi briefly wondered whether it was too late to get a refund. The accommodations seemed nice, but she hadn’t known she’d been signing up for the snooty nobleman treatment.</p>
<p class="cnM5Njk2MGJmZGNmNjRjNTc4YTFkOGFlN2QxNGUzMzI3">“The pleasure is mine,” she said, somewhat tersely. She turned and pulled Saffra along, headed for the opposite end of the room, toward the more private seating.</p>
<p class="cnM3MTRmYmM5YzViMDRiY2E4MDM1OGYzYzYwMzBhNjcy">She made it three steps before an affronted lackey squawked, “That was Lord Barnaby <em>Caldimore </em>who greeted you, if you were unaware.”</p>
<p class="cnNkY2Q3Y2I1MTQ2NzRmNjY5YWExZWQwODQwZTZmNzYw">Saffra stiffened to her side, so apparently she knew the name. Weirdly, it tickled something in Vivi’s memories too. Caldimore. Had that been a plot-relevant lineage in Seven Cataclysms? If so, not an especially important one, because she drew a blank.</p>
<p class="cnM4YWQ1NDk3NWUwNjRkODNiYjkxZTYxMGQ2ZWExYTE0">It was probably best she gave a token response. Repressing a sigh, she turned back. “Vivienne. Saffra.” She gestured at each of them. “As I said, a pleasure.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NWMyOWRkODJlOTRmZjI5MDE2ZDMyZjFhYjQxY2I4">“Vivienne? An unusually human name for a demon,” Lord Caldimore said mildly.</p>
<p class="cnNhOGQ4ZGU3MmY1MzRkMGFiMzU4NDEwOWJkODY1N2Nh">Was it? That was a useful tidbit, even if this interaction was annoying her. She hadn’t known people would think her name odd. In retrospect, it made sense.</p>
<p class="cnNmMmU2MzZjYjg4NDQ4ODU4YjY0OTNlYmQ5YmRkOTVh">“Perhaps,” Vivi replied, turning away again.</p>
<p class="cnMwNGRjODYwZDAyMTRmMjViNThjOWM0MjRjZWEzOWZi">She expected them to press the issue, but they didn’t. They began muttering about her rudeness, and something about ‘low-rank adventurers’. She guessed she would give them credit for not escalating pointlessly.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmRmYjllY2IzZTQwOTliZDk3MzA4MmE1YzMwODc4">She sat with Saffra in the corner of the carriage, in a duo of plush seats. Impressed, Vivi wiggled around as she got situated. So this was the comfort of high-class furniture. She could get used to it.</p>
<p class="cnNlODllZWI5YjkxMTQxMmNhMThkMjQ3N2YxNmI3ZWVl">Saffra looked uneasy. She sent a worried look to the group of nobles. “Should…you have done that?”</p>
<p class="cnNkYWVlZGViZTgxZDQ5NDJiYzBmNzRmOWI5N2ViNzBl">Vivi considered. She studied the men, then threw up a silencing spell so they could talk without concern.</p>
<p class="cnNiMjE5NzI0ZjY4NDQ0Njc4NDY5NzMwNTcyOTc2MTdi">“You knew that name. Caldimore. Who is he?”</p>

## Chapter 17: 17 - Ranger


                <p class="cnNhMWI0YWNlZTk5NzRiYzVhN2ZmZGMzYjAyOWJkN2Qx">“You don’t know who the <em>Caldimores </em>are?” Saffra asked incredulously.</p>
<p class="cnNiOGMwZDc3NTU0ZDRkNzhhM2VlOTdhZDRhN2FiYjNl">“The name sounds vaguely familiar.”</p>
<p class="cnM3N2E0MjBmOWVjNzRhMThiNGUzZjgzYWM5YTJlMjUx">“Vaguely?” Saffra rubbed her face with both hands. “They run the most powerful guild in the Kingdoms. Not him, I’m sure, I’ve never heard of a Barnaby, he’s probably from a branch family. Even so, he’s a count, and a Caldimore!”</p>
<p class="cnMyOTM3MTkxMDRiODQzZGI4N2M2YmJjOGY2OWMyMzkz">“A count?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NmMxYzk4YTU1YjRkYjM5YWExNzQ2OTMzNWVkNmNi">“You know what a count is!” She seemed unsure. “You know what a count is.”</p>
<p class="cnMyN2IzOTJhODYxZDQ1MjJhNGMwZjJmM2JiYmQ2MTVk">Vivi was doing a good job demonstrating her lack of common knowledge. She <em>did </em>know what a count was—sort of. If someone asked her whether a count or an earl ranked higher, she had no idea. Dukes were right below the king, right?</p>
<p class="cnM3Mjk3ZDhmMTFkZTRmNzJhYTVkNDA0ZmJjZGEwOGZh">She waved a hand dismissively, playing the part of Vivisari. “I haven’t thought about human nobility and their titles in a long time. I’ve forgotten.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNzJmYjIyN2ZlOTQ5NjI5MThmNTI5ZGJkZGI4MmQw">Saffra blinked, and seemed to accept that explanation. “Oh. That’s fair.” She hesitated. “You told me to point out if you’re doing something strange, right?”</p>
<p class="cnMzZjdhNDVlNjI2ODQwMDJhYjliNGUxMTMyNGU0MDM3">Vivi raised her eyebrows. “I’ll tell you if it’s intentional.”</p>
<p class="cnNkYmIzMTc1MDE1NjRjOGZhYWNjNzUxZDgyMzBhMjVh">“The silencing spell around us. It’s rude.”</p>
<p class="cnM3Zjc5ZDc1NGVmYzRlMzk5OTQ3MGI4OTVjY2NiMzRi">“It is?”</p>
<p class="cnM3ODEzNWVhNmI1YjQ0OTc5ZTdmNDExYjBkNjNiNzY1">“And suspicious. They’ve probably noticed.”</p>
<p class="cnNjZWM1MDFkMGQ0ZjRjNThiN2E1MzI0ZTk4YjhlZDg5">“Wanting privacy is suspicious?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MGU3NjRkZjhiNDQ3MzQ4M2M3ZTBmOWMwZTllODQw">Saffra shrugged. “No…but yes?”</p>
<p class="cnNmMDkzYzVlNzUzZjQ4MTc5YmE0M2M0YWY1NTc4NDAw">“It’s fine. I don’t care what they think.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWZlNDAxNzU2NzQxOTRhNDIwZDc2ODE0Yzc3YmZm">“If you’re trying to keep out of the spotlight, antagonizing a group of noblemen, and a Caldimore especially, isn’t the way to go about it.”</p>
<p class="cnM4YjAwZTY4NjY5NzRmMjdhZDVhY2MzNTBjNjAxMTEy">“They weren’t polite to us, so I don’t intend to return the favor.”</p>
<p class="cnNiMThlODA1NTM4MzQ4MGE4OGMxM2JkZTg4ZjFkM2Uw">Saffra didn’t press the point, though seemed torn on the issue.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTljZGQ0YTVhNzQwZjI5MzNmOGZkZGZjODYwNTI2">“A count is important?” Vivi asked, continuing the thread from earlier. “And how could you tell he was one?”</p>
<p class="cnNmYmQ1ODA1NWIzOTRiZDk5ZWRmMTEyNDVhZDE3ZjA1">“The insignia on his lapel.” She fiddled at her neck to indicate where she meant. “A count isn’t as high up as you can<em> </em>get, but disrespecting nobility in general is a bad idea. It could get you thrown in a cell if they’re in a bad mood, executed in the worst of cases.”</p>
<p class="cnNlYzk4MzM0MWE0ZDQxZGI5MmIzMzY1ZjI5ZGE3YzFk">Vivi shouldn’t have been taken aback by that, but she was. This wasn’t the fair, democratic society she was used to, she reminded herself.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZjkzNjEwYjIzYjQwZDQ5NzJkNjU4OTIwNjM2MTli">“I guess not you, though,” Saffra said. “Not with your immunity.”</p>
<p class="cnM5N2U0NjYxZGI1MjRhYjlhY2Q1OTAyOTI2ZDg5ODUz">“My immunity?”</p>
<p class="cnNjNDE5MTIwZGQ1ZDRjYmI4ZDY5ZTZhOGU3ZmE0MzE4">“From your levels.” She tilted her head when she saw that Vivi didn’t know what she meant. “I’m not sure what the real term is. When it comes to settling disputes between high-leveled people and nobility, you get an honorary rank, so that there aren’t—issues. As far as the law goes, mithrils are treated as barons, orichalcums as counts, and Titled as marquesses. If I remember right.”</p>
<p class="cnNkYmNiNjkzN2U1MDQzZjZiMTYwMjNkOTY3NzY3ZmI3">That answered her question on how the ranks went. Baron, count, marquess, duke, then the king. And the High King above that, unifying the five human kingdoms.</p>
<p class="cnNjNWUxNDI2ZjVhZDRhMmU5NGExZGFkOTY4MDkzMjYz">“But in this case it isn’t even about rank. You might have an honorary legal title, maybe even higher than his, but disrespecting the Caldimore family is what’s really playing with fire.”</p>
<p class="cnNjNmE0ZjY4MGE1YTQ2Mjg5MTAxZTQzMTBmMzE5MmEw">“They head a powerful guild, you said. Which?”</p>
<p class="cnNmMjUyZDJiYWM4MjQ3MjZhNmI5YWZmZTlkZDI4ZTNm">“The Wardens.”</p>
<p class="cnNjY2RmZTQ3NzkzNDQyYzI4NDM4NDRkOTVlNjViYTYz">Vivi had wondered whether she would recognize the name, perhaps as one of the competing guilds in her previous life. But it rang no bells.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTU3ZGMyMzVkNTRkZGE5OGQzMzg3MTM1MmMwNjNh">“Hm. What of Vanguard?”</p>
<p class="cnM3MzMzZWY2OTFkNjQ4NjBiMGE3NGU5NDgzYzkzOTRj">Saffra looked surprised. “The Party of Heroes?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMWI5ZDc2ZGRmNDQ1MDA5ODI2MDJlNWNiZjJkN2E4">“Their guild, yes.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNWIzYjIxMTQ2NjQ1MWRiNTdkYjkxM2EyZTFlNTJl">“Well…nothing? I mean, the only members were the five heroes, and their craftsmen and other staff, but they’ve scattered to the wind. Since the guild can’t <em>really </em>exist anymore, not without an officer. I mean, you do know what happened with the Party of Heroes, right?” She blinked. “Surely.”</p>
<p class="cnM2MTQ3NzNkODk1ODQxYjI4ZDIzNDVkMjhkMzVkNTk4">“I do.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNWVkOGRmYzc0NzQ3NjBhYzA1YmZiOWQyNzZjN2Nj">Bringing herself up in a roundabout manner hadn’t triggered a sudden realization in Saffra. Enough indicators were there to form a suspicion: extremely high-level demon mage missing for many decades narrowed a person down, and one named <em>Vivi </em>no less. But some things were too unbelievable, she supposed, to formulate in one’s head. To Saffra, Vivisari was a hero of legend. She might never make the connection unless Vivi hit her over the head with it.</p>
<p class="cnM0MjdhNDQ5NjcwMDRlM2I5NWVhMDQ4NmJjZGUyYzc2">As for her guild. In stasis, she supposed? She knew the guild <em>existed </em>thanks to how her affiliation appeared when checking her status screen, but anything beyond that remained a mystery. Hopefully the building still stood, and more importantly, the vault. The items inside were more valuable than even her personal stash.</p><span class="cmIwZWQ0ZjM0NjkwYTRiMDlhMTQ3ZmRhMjcyNjhkNzk4"><br>Stolen story; please report.<br></span>
<p class="cnM2NTQ0N2M0NWU1MTQxYzc5M2FjYTQ3NWE3NTJmM2Q2">“Anyway, point being, being rude to a Caldimore, branch family or not, is maybe not the best idea,” Saffra said. “I’m just letting you know. You can do whatever you want, of course.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNTk2MGJiMDE1MTQ4OWI5YWRjYzJmNTM0ZjBhMTI3">Vivi intended to.</p>
<p class="cnNlMWM3Y2UzYjdlMjRmMmY4ZWJjM2RlYmRmZjI5ZTk3">The conversation stilled as a newcomer boarded, drawing all attention his way. A longbow and a quiver hung strapped to his back, and he wore earthy tones: dark browns and greens. His hood was pulled down to reveal a thin face with stubble on his chin, a prominent nose, and blue eyes. He paused at the entrance, gaze flicking around in a way Vivi recognized as scanning for threats. His eyes lingered on Vivi, narrowing in interest, before he turned away.</p>
<p class="cnNkZTk5YzY5OWJmYTQ5YTRiOGVlYzUwNTI2ZTcxZjk2">A green badge was pinned to his chest. Orichalcum rank.</p>
<p class="cnNkMmRmYTdhOTIwNTRjZjA5NzAwOTIyMmZkYTdiNDE3">The greeting he received couldn’t be more different from theirs. Barnaby, followed by his band of admirers, stood from the semi-circle arrangement of sofas and made a dramatic show of welcoming him.</p>
<p class="cnMzN2ViYTkyYmRkMTRiZjBhN2FmMjgxN2JjNWEzMTBi">“Ah, now there’s one of the Kingdom’s finest!” Lord Barnaby exclaimed gregariously. “Jasper Trevane, if I’m not mistaken?”</p>
<p class="cnM0Y2ZmNmFmZGFkYjRjNjA4MzdlMjQ4MGNiODA4Zjg0">To Vivi’s immense amusement, the ranger-adventurer didn’t even attempt a stiff level of politeness like Vivi had. He walked in, turned left, and headed straight for the side table spread with food and drink. One of the servants stepped forward as if to aid him, but he waved him away, grabbing the nearest bottle of wine to tear the cork out with his fingers.</p>
<p class="cnM2MzkxOTI1YzJiNjQxNTFhMTdlZDk1YTViMDEyMmQ2">Only after he’d downed eight deep glugs of the red liquid—holding a finger up at Barnaby in the meanwhile as if to say, ‘I’ll respond when I’m done’—did he finally drop the bottle and sigh in contentment.</p>
<p class="cnNhN2UwYWQzYjRjYzQzMDlhMzliODYxMTQ4YTU1OTlh">“Alright,” the adventurer said, turning to the group of noblemen. “I’m ready to kiss my legally mandated ass, since Mae said one more incident and I’ll be out on mine. So, one at a time, ladies, I’m sure you can’t wait to start hurling your titles at me.” He gestured with the wine bottle at Barnaby, sloshing some of the red liquid onto the carpet. “You first, ringleader. Gotta be someone important, since you’ve got a White Glove attending you.”</p>
<p class="cnNkOTRiMWZlMWM0ODQ4YjRhYzEyZDhjZjQ5MjRhMzg2">White Glove? Jasper’s eyes had flicked to the maid as he used the term, but the woman hadn’t reacted. She stood to the side, hands clasped in front of her apron, posture ramrod straight, face smooth and green eyes calm.</p>
<p class="cnM1OTY4NzY2YTkzZTQzYWJiNDgxOTA1ODk0MWNiZmFm">Lord Barnaby Caldimore’s smile had frozen. “I heard you were a character,” he said, the boisterous cheer strained. “I suppose it takes a certain personality to reach the heights you have.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNmEyODhkODVmMTRlYzJiNmFjNTljNTllZDMyZTll">“Oh? Ass kissing of my own? Do go on.” He took another drink.</p>
<p class="cnMxNWJkYThiZjY3NzRjY2I5NGYwMGZkY2JhNjkzOWZm">“Lord Barnaby Caldimore,” the nobleman said, inclining his head respectfully. “A true pleasure indeed.”</p>
<p class="cnNlMTJiZTJlOTZmMjRiOTBiOWYxNWJmODhiYjllYTlk">Jasper wiped his mouth, his eyebrows raising. “Caldimore. Guess that explains the Glove, when you’re just some count.” He returned the bow, and even Vivi could tell it was several degrees too shallow.</p>
<p class="cnNmMTg5MWVkMTljOTRiZDZiNDliM2EyNjRlMDY4MTE0">Barnaby didn’t respond to the dismissive remark about his rank. “Orichalcums always have the most fascinating stories. Care to join our table?” The offer didn’t sound genuine at this point.</p>
<p class="cnM0NzUyOTk0NjNjNDRiYWQ4M2ViZDUyYTZjNDA1MGM0">“Maybe after I catch up.” He waggled the bottle, spilling more onto the carpet.</p>
<p class="cnMwNWE3MmYyN2VhYjQ3NzY5M2Y1Yjg4MGM2YjAyYTg4">Barnaby eyed the growing red stains, but once more didn’t comment. His tone was stiff when he said, “I see. I look forward to it.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NmFhY2Y3Yjk5MzRkNmU4OGIwZWVlYTE5OWMyNjQz">Jasper dropped into one of the chairs separated from the main group, and apart from Vivi and Saffra as well. She caught him peeking out of the corner of his eye at her, and, seeing her looking, he waved a lazy hand and winked.</p>
<p class="cnM1MzkxOGM5M2IwNjQzMTFhZjFjNzcwYTdlYzRjZGI0">Vivi ignored him. “White Glove?” she asked Saffra.</p>
<p class="cnMwYmM4YTYzNWYzZTRiNjA4YjMyNzI3NWFjM2MyMDM0">Saffra jumped, having been as absorbed in the exchange as Vivi. “Um. They’re—maids and butlers. Is she really one? She does seem…serious.” Her gaze drifted over, now extremely interested in the maid.</p>
<p class="cnMxNWNmZTFhZGQ0OTRiMDFhYTM4NjhlMmZiNWZhMDk1">“They’re more than that, I take it,” Vivi prompted.</p>
<p class="cnM4MTZlMjVjNzlkZTQzYjc5NTRlMWMxNjFiNmQ3ZTI3">Saffra tore her eyes back. “If she’s actually a Glove, she’s at least mithril rank. I think. The White Gloves are some of the best bodyguards in the world. And they can run an entire estate’s staff too. Everyone in the world wants one. They’re stupidly expensive. Even if he is a Caldimore, I’m surprised he hired one. Is there a reason?” Her attention drifted away from Vivi, lips pulling down into a frown as she studied him. “I can only imagine he’s expecting an assassin, or something crazy like that. Or he’s just paranoid. I guess when you’ve got more gold than a dragon, even Gloves aren’t expensive. He <em>is</em> a Caldimore.”</p>
<p class="cnNmN2IyOTdlNDNkOTQyZDg5NDUyYjZkMmZmMWJjYmJj">“Mithril rank doesn’t seem very strong, all things considered.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MGUyOTY3NTQyNzQzYzViMzE0NDU4ODViOGI4MWM4">Saffra paused, then snorted. “To you. But I guess you’re right, in the grand scheme of things. But she’s <em>at least</em> mithril. That’s what a Glove’s graduation requirement is.” She squirmed in her seat, cheeks coloring slightly. “I think. You do know I’m basically a nobody, right? I only know about this stuff in a general sense.”</p>
<p class="cnNlMmVkZWM2MjhjYjQ0Y2ViNTEzYTgyYTJkZmQxODU2">“More than I do.”</p>
<p class="cnMzN2JmOTgwZTJmZjRkNzU5YTZhNDdmMmY0ODJjYWI1">“That’s not saying much.” Saffra cleared her throat, realizing the retort might be perceived as rude, and she was clearly trying to put on her best behavior. “But yeah, who knows what her level is. Also, she’s a bodyguard and a servant. It’s her entire class to protect people. She should be able to fight well above her level if it’s in defense of her client. Honestly,” she murmured, looking at the ranger. “I wonder who would win between the two of them?”</p>
<p class="cnNmNmYxMjkxMGVhNjRlNTdiODBlMDY2NmI4YjVjYzlh">Oh? Her class gave that much of a boost, since it was so specialized? Enough that a mithril might win against an orichalcum?</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmJjMGZjMjkxZDQ0MjY5MGYwMDcxYjFmZDMyNmQz">Vivi had to admit, she was fascinated by the idea. She’d been making efforts not to stare at the maid, already interested in her outfit and prim demeanor even before she’d been revealed as some super-elite member of a combat-maid organization. She’d always loved the idea of combat-butlers, hence why her personal assistant in Seven Cataclysms had been one. Combat-maids were, naturally, equally as cool.</p>
<p class="cnM4OTNiZDBhZTY0NzRmMWRhOWQwYzA0NGExYTE5OTE0">Once more, she wondered what had happened to Winston. She desperately hoped he was alive, and not just because he had been seriously<em> </em>upgraded—he had to be the equivalent of a Titled, assuming he was kicking around. Personal Assistants hadn’t had levels, per se, following a different progression scheme to better suit the game’s mechanics, but he’d been more than capable of protecting the manor from assailants, or aiding her in an admittedly limited manner in combat.</p>
<p class="cnNhZWU1MzNjYTFhNjQ2NjhhYjAxYzU1MDY4OTJiNjgz">She wondered if he’d found someone else to serve, or had moved on in a different way. It would be understandable, seeing how it had been a century. A strange sense of melancholy passed across her. Would it be hoping for too much that when she showed up in Meridian, he would be there, watching over the manor after all these years?</p>
<p class="cnNiNGQ3Y2E0ZjdjYjQ4MWU5NmEwY2IxM2Q5NDlkMjlm">“Who’s the ranger?” Vivi asked.</p>
<p class="cnMzNjQ1MzlkZDg1MzQ1ZGI4M2E2ZTlkNDYzYTVjZjU4">“Jasper Trevane. I mean, I wouldn’t have known that, I’ve never seen him, and I only kind of recognize the name. He’s a poison specialist I think? Coats his arrows. From the Central Kingdom. Not the most famous, but he <em>is </em>orichalcum. I can’t remember what guild he’s in, or which party.”</p>
<p class="cnNmYzQ4MTUyNmM2NTRkM2U5Y2IzZjBkMzRjNzJhOTQw">Despite calling him ‘not the most famous’, Saffra was sneaking admiring looks at him. Seeing how the man had almost polished off that bottle of wine already, Vivi couldn’t help but feel like she could choose a better role model.</p>
<p class="cnNjNjJiMmVlZWRhYzQxMDI5ZDMyYzE2ODU4NDU3MDJm">He did have a rugged sort of handsomeness, Vivi supposed. And she would be lying if the sarcastic attitude from earlier hadn’t entertained her. She had mixed feelings on him overall, but if she’d had a trace of interest in romance, her gaze might have lingered.</p>
<p class="cnMzZjU4MzhhMWEzYjRmNzU4MzRmYTQ5YjhkODIzYjc1">Pausing, she realized said rugged handsomeness might be why <em>Saffra’s</em> attention kept flitting over to him. Vivi’s eyes narrowed. He was at least three times her age. That better not be why.</p>
<p class="cnMxNzA2ODc0MDk1ODRlM2M5MzljMGU3NmI2ZjE2N2Rh">“You requested lessons, yes?” Vivi asked.</p>
<p class="cnNmZjM3YzNjNTUyNzQ4NDQ4NmExNTIwODkwNmQ0MTBi">That had Saffra’s gaze snapping back, her eyes widening, and her head bobbing rapidly. There was a clear winner between ‘magic lessons’ and ‘interesting orichalcum-rank’, and it wasn’t close.</p>
<p class="cnM2MWFlOWVhZDAzYTQwY2VhMTFkMGU3MGNkYjI5MmJm">“Let’s start from the beginning, then. Show me your channeling capacity.”</p>

## Chapter 18: 18 - The Mechanics of Magic


                <p class="cnNlNTQ1ZTBiZDNmNDQ4ZDM5MjAxZDc0ZWUyYzBiNTVm">Saffra had been less nervous for the Institute Qualification Exams.</p>
<p class="cnM0MTAzMGY1OTYyMTRiYjE5OGVjMjI1ODViNTYzNzgz">Which didn’t make sense. She wasn’t being evaluated, not in a way that had any consequences. Her magical competence clearly wasn’t the primary factor—if a factor at all—for why Lady Vivi had accepted her apprenticeship proposition.</p>
<p class="cnM4YTU4NjJkZDNhNzRhZTlhYjE2ODgzNWJmZGIxNTJi">As for what the actual factors were? She had no idea. That Vivi ‘needed a guide’ didn’t explain enough. She could get one of those anywhere.</p>
<p class="cnNkNWI3YzUxYjkzMzQxMmNiYWI2M2Y3NzkwNWI4NTdi">A whim? High-level adventurers, high-level <em>anybodies</em>, tended to be eccentric. Would she be tossed aside in a month’s time? A week’s? Tomorrow?</p>
<p class="cnMwZjhiNDllYWZiMDQyNDk5NDRhMzg3YTUxYTRjYjE1">She had resigned herself to that, so she wouldn’t be especially devastated. Even a week’s tutelage from a mage of this caliber made for an unparalleled opportunity.</p>
<p class="cnM3YTgyN2FjNzc5OTQxZDRhNTlkMGUyMjYwMzhhYjA2">And if she could extend Lady Vivi’s interest a few days by displaying a modicum of talent, she would do everything she could.</p>
<p class="cnM5M2VjM2UzZTYyODRkZjBhMjdjNmExZDYyNjgwODJj">“I don’t know how the Institute educates its students,” Vivi said, “nor how most mages refer to the processes of magic, so bear with me if I use unfamiliar terminology. And feel free to ask for clarification.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNzc4OWUzNjYzNTQxNDBiMGE3NGVmY2VhNmI5NWJk">Saffra was interested. A mage without a formal education? Those weren’t the rarest, though in the modern era, definitely less common in the highest echelons of talent. That said, despite Lady Vivi’s ambiguously youthful appearance, she had to be at least a few centuries old. She wasn’t <em>from </em>the modern era. She had likely seen, maybe even partaken in, the fights against the Cataclysms. That was a humbling thought.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZWIyMzE4MjZhMTRhZTE5NTI5OTZmNDM0M2MwNTgy">“We’ll begin with mana control. Circle it through your channels. As much as you can at once.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNTA1YTczODAzYTRkY2RhZjdkMWIyNzY5ZTFhYTBh">A common exercise, and a starting point Saffra had expected. She was on familiar ground. She supposed the basics were the basics; what else would Vivi have asked for, formal education or not?</p>
<p class="cnNlMjZlZDgyNDEyNzQ3YjM4YzZjOGE2N2U3Y2M3NDk3">Saffra closed her eyes and focused. Her mana core sat high in her stomach, behind her sternum. It wasn’t a physical organ, but rather a purely magical structure. Over time—with training and levels—the amount of mana it could store grew.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDFlYjBhNmM2ZTQyZjhiYWY5MzZiOWRhZTdmYWEz">But a healthy mana pool was only one small part of what made a mage powerful. To draw a comparison, her pool was like her stamina. But stamina didn’t mean strength. Strength was channeling capacity, and indicated much better the overall power of a mage. After all, being able to cast ten thousand tier-0 spells didn’t matter nearly as much as being able to cast five higher-tier ones.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTY4NzFmMzFjMTQ2ZGViMmZlN2FhNTllNjVmMDVi">That vibrating molten liquid filled her magical veins, and she breathed deeply with satisfaction. She had always loved the feeling of mana suffusing her channels. It made her feel powerful, in control of a situation, however much of an illusion she knew it to be. Magic hadn’t saved her any of the times she had needed saving. It would be a long time yet before she was strong enough to protect herself. It might never happen.</p>
<p class="cnNhZDc4ZDE3Yjg2ZjRlZDNiZDg1NGM5YTA2MWY2YzM3">The test began. She only stopped flooding herself with mana when she felt ready to burst. There were dozens of exit points throughout the body—the Institute called them gates—and she struggled not to let mana leak through.</p>
<p class="cnMyNTg2ZDJiM2MyZDQwNjQ5YmYxZWNmMmNiNDRjMzQ1">She moved that primordial resource around her channels, feeling as if she were setting herself on fire. The experience wasn’t pleasant, but she enjoyed the discomfort in the way a sprinter might enjoy the burn in their legs.</p>
<p class="cnMwZmI3MDY0YWEyMTQxNTg4NTFjYTM5M2U1NDRmYjI2">At least until the burn turned painful, then agonizing. Sweat dripped from her brow as seconds and a full minute passed. She struggled to maintain her breathing, refusing to stop until Vivi allowed it. Her mentor had to know how difficult this was. It was a test, and Saffra needed to impress.</p>
<p class="cnMyZDM5M2M1YjM1MDQ2OGU5YTJiNGJjNDZiMDY1ZmM0">“That’s enough,” Vivi said what felt like three years later, and Saffra pulled the mana back into herself and sagged into her seat, gasping.</p>
<p class="cnM3MDBmODMyNzQxOTQyMzM5YzI5YjE5ODQ0NGI0NjA2">Vivi gave her a moment to recover.</p>
<p class="cnNhN2NmZjMwM2RjZDRiZWNhMDk2MjU1ZjhjMWY4ZDgw">“That was enough flow to manage a fifth-tier spell,” she said, “but I expect not enough for a sixth-tier.”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTRhYWEzNDIwYTQ4Mzk4NzAzOGI4NTgwN2VkZTI5">Saffra couldn’t help but feel affronted. Of course she couldn’t cast a sixth-tier spell. She wasn’t even level four hundred yet! A fifth-tier spell at her level was already impressive, even by institute standards, and moreover, Vivi’s wording seemed to imply Saffra was closing in on the sixth tier. That was <em>extremely</em> impressive!</p>
<p class="cnNmMDQyYzcxNGY3YjQ1MjU4YjA0MjI0NGY4YWZmNjFh">Saffra’s shoulders slumped. She supposed this was the downside of being taught by a prodigy. The demon in front of her had probably been casting fifth-tier spells before she could walk. Of course Saffra’s efforts hadn’t impressed, even if she’d tried her hardest.</p>
<p class="cnNkYmUwYzgyMzQzMzQ3NjdiNmQwYmY3MzBjYWJmNzhm">“But well done,” Vivi added after a moment’s pause.</p>
<p class="cnM0YWNiMzQzZjFiNzQ2YTdiMWUzYmRiYzA4OTE4NzAx">Saffra snorted. She was getting better at reading the woman. Vivi had clearly tacked that on because she had deflated. The mismatch between her outward appearance—those bored red eyes that were borderline contemptuous—and how her words and actions were always gentle was more than a little amusing.</p>
<p class="cnMyZDYzMWQ3NGJmYzQ1ZDA4ZTg3YTkxOWViZjFjMDQx">Honestly, it was the reason Saffra had trusted her so quickly. She could see past a person’s surface layers. She was a good judge of character.</p>
<p class="cnM4NWE1ZjIwNWM4YTQzYzQ4N2EwNmI0YTdiNzM5MDBj">Except for a few very important instances.</p>
<p class="cnNmNDIzYzcyMzcxOTRiMDhhMzA2NDU0ZjliN2VmOGY5">Even having her thoughts brush against the most recent example made her flinch. Yes, there was definitely one major exception, and it was why she didn’t attend the Institute anymore.</p>
<p class="cnNjZTU2ZmNkOWMwMjQxNTViYjQyN2IxMzhjNzk1MTQ4">Her eyes drifted over to Lord Barnaby Caldimore, taking brief note of the blurring landscape beyond the windows. She’d been so absorbed in the lesson that she hadn’t noticed the Convoy leave the station.</p>
<p class="cnNlMGI4YjFiZGJhMTQwNTRiZWZjNjk4NTJlOWZmY2Ji">Caldimore. What were the odds? She’d been irrationally worried he would recognize her, but obviously he hadn’t. In the grand scheme of things, her expulsion hadn’t been important to anybody. Not even the family most involved with it.</p>
<p class="cnNmOWEwMGEwOTlhNzQ2NDBhYzY2YmQxNDQwZDEyNWE2">She wondered what <em>she </em>was up to, these days. Did she even care what she’d done? Had the whole thing been a joke?</p>
<p class="cnM1MzQzNzZiNDllZTRkMWQ4ODk1ZjY0Y2M5NTI5Y2E2">She shoved those thoughts away. She was done thinking about Isabelle.</p>
<p class="cnMxNjBjYTBhN2Y4ZjQwNTdhYjRlNjdlY2M5MGNhZjRl">“Channeling at high fifth-tier when I haven’t even reached the benchmark level for fourth-tier is impressive, by the way,” Saffra declared, sticking her chin up. “Especially when I have half the education most casters do.”</p><span class="cjU5N2U1OTQxNWE5ODQ1M2M4ZmI5ZjU2YWYzYzgxYTg4"><br>The story has been taken without consent; if you see it on Amazon, report the incident.<br></span>
<p class="cnNiYTM5YzA4NTczYjQ5MDFhZjk0OWIyNzcxN2UyYzc0">The words were for her own benefit, and she felt embarrassed the moment they came out of her mouth. But thinking about Isabelle had sent her spiraling again, and she always felt better when she blustered.</p>
<p class="cnM2OGQ5MWJiNGU1MTRlNjBhOTAyMzAzZjI2MGNkYzcy">That she cared so much after eight months infuriated her. Isabelle certainly didn’t care. She’d probably howled with laughter for days afterward, then promptly forgotten about her.</p>
<p class="cnNiZGExYmIzNGYxOTRiYjRhYTBhMTRjMDdiYWY2YjIz">“I expect it is,” Vivi said in her usual calm voice, though those red eyes were watching her carefully. Some of what Saffra had been feeling had probably leaked through.</p>
<p class="cnNiMTViMTA0MzgwMzRmYTg4OTJjNmNlZDY0OGUzZGY2">“What now?” Saffra asked, shifting uncomfortably in her seat.</p>
<p class="cnM3NzdhOWM1NTlhODRiZDQ5YTM4MWE1OTUzYzIzZDVm">Vivi’s attention lingered a little longer before she replied, “Let’s see your external mana manipulation.”</p>
<p class="cnMzZWQ1MDJkY2E3ZDQ1MzM4MjgxNzY2NjgxNzAzMTM5">She seized the distraction.</p>
<p class="cnM5ZDljNmZiNDljNjRjNWZhZTAzNGUxNjYwNzAxOTI2">Internal channeling capacity determined how quickly a mage could funnel mana through their body, through their channels, and out their gates. Not only was it the limiter for how high-tier of a spell someone could cast, it also decided how quickly a spell could be formed and activated. A spell required a certain amount of fuel, and the faster a mage fed it, the faster the spell could be formed and then incanted.</p>
<p class="cnMwM2UwNzgwY2RhYjRmNjViZjU2MTc2NGJkMTAzNzRj">But power and speed weren’t everything. Technique and knowledge were equally important. Perhaps more so. It didn’t matter how fast a mage could feed their spell if the design was inefficient, or worse, unstable. Moreover, it didn’t matter how excellent the spell design was if the user’s technical ability—how well they could execute said design—failed to reach incantation requirements.</p>
<p class="cnM1ODkxYzY5MGNiMjRkMWZiMGVhMTJjNGM2YzkyNWQ4">“Do as I do,” Vivi said, lifting a pointer finger and extruding an orb of mana.</p>
<p class="cnMzNTY3YTdjZjU4NDQ2ZjU5YmY1ZDBjZmNiY2U5YWJm">Saffra focused. Liquid energy thrummed through her as she siphoned mana from her core. This time she didn’t circle it around her body pointlessly as a channeling exercise, but expelled it through the gate on her pointer finger.</p>
<p class="cnNkMmU0ZTBhODA3MTQ3MjY4YjVjMTM0MjQxMGEzZDQ0">Mana in one’s own body was many times easier to control. The moment it entered the air, it began to wriggle away like a live, buttered fish. The mana still belonged to her, but heavens above, it didn’t want to be. Only with concentration did she wrangle the mana into a neat orb, compressing it down into a sphere that quavered slightly.</p>
<p class="cnNlODk5YTc0ZmI5YjQ5ZDZiYzAzNjQwNjQ3NTMyMDUw">Vivi’s ball of mana was so glassy-smooth and unwavering that no matter how hard Saffra squinted at it, she couldn’t sense the smallest fluctuation.</p>
<p class="cnM3OTBkODE5YzU5ODRmMTQ5OTBmZWY3ZTZlYzZhZTEz">She had a feeling she was about to be humbled even more than she’d braced herself for.</p>
<p class="cnM5Nzg5MTFmYzJiMTQyNmJhMTY5YmIyNjYyZjY4OTEx">Vivi waggled her finger left and right, and the orb followed. Saffra did the same; that part was easier than holding the mana in a sphere.</p>
<p class="cnNiOTlkYTFhZDM3NDQ1YzQ5OWJjZDc1ZjAwN2FhYzEw">A series of demonstrations ensued in which Saffra did her best to imitate Vivi. She moved the orb left and right, up and down, in circles—then in geometric shapes, a triangle, square, pentagon. These weren’t unfamiliar training routines, since moving mana around in deliberate ways was fundamental to drawing spell circles, but Saffra struggled to keep up. Vivi slowed when Saffra faltered, but it was clear she wasn’t having issues herself. Not that she would expect a mage of her caliber to.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTdhNmM4YzllNDQ4MGJhMWRiYzE4NjZiZmFhNzZh">When Vivi extruded a second orb, Saffra really had to focus.</p>
<p class="cnNhNjQ4ZGMzYTViZjQ3Y2M4MTJhMDc5ODZhNjJlOTMz">“I expect at your level, controlling many simultaneous streams isn’t important,” Vivi said. “Low-tier mages are limited by their channeling capacity, not how quickly they can trace the circle itself.”</p>
<p class="cnMwMTI2OTRiYmVhYTRjMzc4ZmRjOWE5MDQ4MzY2YTcz">It took Saffra a second to understand, because ninety percent of her brain was occupied with keeping the two spheres moving like they should. If holding one wriggling fish was hard, imagine two.</p>
<p class="cnM1MWI3ZDYwMjA5MzQ3M2U4ZTUwNzhhMDcxYThjODhk">“That’s how you cast so fast,” Saffra said. “Almost instantly. You have the channeling power, obviously, but you can also draw the whole diagram at once by painting with ten brushes at the same time. Or—how many streams can you manage?”</p>
<p class="cnMzZDAxYTA5ODY5NjRmNTFhYjc2MTI5ZTlhOTZhNzFm">In demonstration, Vivi split the two orbs into four, then eight, then sixteen, then thirty-two. Saffra sat back numbly in her chair as she watched the mass of orbs fly to their respective positions and each trace a portion of a low-tier spell she recognized as [Ignite]. With so many ‘paintbrushes’, it took less than a second. And Vivi had clearly slowed the process for Saffra’s sake.</p>
<p class="cnNiYWI4ZGNhZjYxYTQwNWY5OGE0MGFlMDEzNzI4Nzky">When would she stop being stunned at what this woman was capable of?</p>
<p class="cnM2ZWMwNzgxZTM4MzQ0Y2I5ZGI0YWE4MWU0MGRjMTU1">“That does explain it,” Saffra muttered.</p>
<p class="cnM5YWQ3MjVkOGFiMjQ4Y2ViZjM0NzgwMzJkZDFhN2I3">Vivi canceled the spell circle and sucked the mana back into herself, which made Saffra wince. Reclaiming expelled mana was more than a little painful, but Vivi’s face didn’t so much as twitch.</p>
<p class="cnMyMWEzN2JmNmE0MDQ4YjI5ZDdlMmZiYzMwYTUxNTA2">“At your level, it’s forgivable to deprioritize multitasking.” She extruded a single sphere, and Saffra smashed her two existing ones back together to mimic her. “Fine control is more important as a beginner. It’ll be some time before you can move past that fundamental weakness of mages.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNzlmMTg5YTRkMDRjZjI4ZWI2OTkwNzcxZjhiZjE2">Their fundamental weakness: slow cast times. Mages made poor solo fighters because of that, though they <em>could </em>handle themselves if they ensured they always had the drop on their enemy. A disabling spell into some form of artillery worked wonders, and wasn’t hard to set up with preparation. But there was no way to guarantee the first strike in every encounter, so mages primarily worked in teams.</p>
<p class="cnNmYzZlYjNiZTQyZjQ5ODZiMDI4ZDk2MzZlNjAzYWVh">“Then again, if you focus on simultaneous mana streams and low-tier magic, you could succeed with a versatile, rapid casting strategy. It depends on what your desired outcome is.”</p>
<p class="cnNjMTk2NjUxZWJlMzRmZjRhMjYyMTZiYTE3NTI4ODQw">“I don’t mind being artillery.” The standard mage role. The idea of rapidly casting weak spells wasn’t half as appealing.</p>
<p class="cnNkMzMxM2NkYzcwMTRkOTdiODA2ODQzMDIxOTk5ODBi">Vivi nodded. “Then focus on fine control. Let’s talk spells. Which do you use most often?”</p>
<p class="cnNmYmVmYzgwM2Y5NzQxZmY4Y2Q3ODhjNzdjNGExZDNl">Saffra’s pulse sped up. This was what she’d been hoping for. Useful as mana control exercises and such were, the real value of an experienced mage taking her under their wing—besides the eventual apprenticeship boost, which could take days to manifest—was being taught new spells, or how to improve and perfect existing ones.</p>
<p class="cnM5MmZlNmQ4Njc2ZDQwYjlhNzA3YWVkMzhkZTFiZjE0">“I’ve been hoping for an elementalist class evolution,” Saffra said, “so I’ve been using mostly fire and ice spells. Depending on the monster’s resistances, I use [Flame Bolt] or [Ice Spear] as my go-to. [Fireball] when I have a lot of time to channel, like when we have the drop on a strong one. A basic [Arcane Shield] for self-defense, of course, and [Frostbind] or [Ice Slick] for utility and disruption.” She bit her lip. “Those are the most common, but I have a larger arsenal than that, of course. I…I can show you my grimoire if you want.”</p>
<p class="cnM0NDVjNTcyMTA0ZTQzMzg5YjM4MDUwNmQ0OTgzODAx">Normally, a grimoire was something a mage protected fiercely, sometimes not handing it over even to their spouse. It represented, literally, a mage’s life work, revealing every spell that the Grand System recognized proficiency in. Saffra had a total of thirty-three spells in her grimoire, but most were low-tier.</p>
<p class="cnNhYTdmMDk4YmJmMjRiYTNiNjUwNGE3MTRjNTUzMzIz">In classic fashion, her attempt at earnestness and her implicit show of trust were pointless, because Vivi asked curiously, “Grimoire?”</p>
<p class="cnNmNmZkNzhmYmZkNjQzNGJiNzdjNTQwYzhmZmNjZDc5">Saffra stared at her. This one was criminal. “Grimoire. You’re—you’re one of the strongest mages I’ve ever seen! How can you not know what a grimoire is? The book that has all your spells in it!” Bewildered, she said, “You summon it through your spell screen?”</p>
<p class="cnM4MTFhOTkzYjliZjRhZWRiN2JjNzc3NDY3ZTgxMzg4">Vivi tilted her head. “Spell screen. Does every mage have one of those?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NGI2NGNlMDBlMTQyNWM4ZjAyMDA5ODczODY3NzA1">“As soon as they learn their first spell, they should.” It was more than a little disorienting to be answering such basic questions for someone who was her senior in magic by several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p class="cnMwYmUwOTBjYmZhZjRiZjc4Y2RkOGJjYmE1ZGU3YmJm">Saffra had a working theory for the origin of Vivi’s gaps in knowledge. It was a grim but plausible one. Memory loss—maybe magical in origin, maybe as simple as a head injury earned during combat. She couldn’t imagine another explanation for why she knew so much and so little, in seemingly random fashion.</p>
<p class="cnM3OGM3ZjQyMjkzODQ3YTJhNzBjZDIxY2ZmNzNhZTVk">“I see. Interesting.” Her eyes latched onto, presumably, her spell screen. “I have one then? A grimoire? How do I access it?”</p>
<p class="cnNkYWQzZmIwMjZkZTQ2MWU5Y2Q5ZTkxMmVhZmQ3ZGQ4">Saffra opened her own spell screen and commanded, “[Grimoire].” The screen disappeared, and a book dropped into her hands.</p>
<p class="cnMyZTBlNDUyMzA4MjQ4YzVhOTliMDllOTBlYzc4Mzcx">A person’s grimoire evolved throughout their life, changing in design according to the individual, and in thickness according to the number of spells inside.</p>
<p class="cnMxYzEzNDc3MWRhODQ2ZDQ5NzQ5ZDVkODFhN2M2M2Q5">Saffra’s was earthy-red leather with tan strings tying it closed. At thirty-three pages, it wasn’t the most pathetic grimoire in existence, but it wasn’t impressive. Level four hundred wasn’t a shabby level even for adult mages, but it wasn’t remotely approaching the pinnacles of magehood.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZWQ2MTFjNzc2ZjQwZjI4OTEyYWY3M2Y1MTQ1ODM0">Archmage Lysander, the headmaster of the Institute, liked to carry his grimoire around strapped to his belt, obviously to show off. And as much as she disliked him, she begrudgingly admitted she was impressed whenever she laid eyes on that white gilded tome. It took dedication to add that many spells to one’s arsenal, even if he’d been vain and learned low-tier ones to fatten the book out. Which she wouldn’t put past him.</p>
<p class="cnNjNDk3MDg4YmYzYTQyNDk4ZmE3M2MwYWMwMjc2MDUz">Grimoires were status symbols in the mage world. They were a way of signaling one’s breadth of magical knowledge at a glance—much like an adventurer’s badge, but with even more personalization and flair.</p>
<p class="cnM0MWE4NTc0YTY1OTQ3YzU4OTJjOGY5NGZlODJiYzk5">Vivi studied Saffra’s book with interest, then turned her attention toward her spell screen.</p>
<p class="cnMwYWMwN2RhYTk1ODQ4Nzk4ZDEyY2Y2NWI2ZmYwOGFk">“[Grimoire],” she said.</p>

## Chapter 19: 19 - Grimoires


                <p class="cnMzNTZkYjYxZmM1YzRhMTc4MzgwYzA2YzMwMzE3NDlj">The tome that landed in Vivi’s lap was unexpectedly substantial in all dimensions—tall, thick, and wide. Unlike Saffra’s, Vivi’s grimoire featured a polished obsidian cover adorned with elegant designs made from an unusual, almost pearlescent violet metal. Centered on the front was a raised ivory crown, points tipped with red gemstones. Ornate didn’t begin to describe the book’s appearance.</p>
<p class="cnNkZmY4N2Y4OGFlYzRmMDhiNzA0ZjcwODY5NjkyMGYz">There was a solid heft to the grimoire as she picked it up, and when she flipped it open, the spell diagram and description of her lowest-level spell met her: [Illuminate], a tier-0 that summons a glowing ball of light. Looping black ink on cream parchment described the ability. She saw no additional information over what she could have found on her spell screen, but she admitted it was an interesting feature, being able to summon her spell list into a physical vessel.</p>
<p class="cnM0NTQxNWVkMmQ4MjQ0YTQ4N2QxNjE1NmQ4MzE2NWMy">When she lifted her gaze, she found Saffra gawking at her with an even more pronounced look of astonishment than usual.</p>
<p class="cnNlOTg0M2ZmZjBjYTQwNzViNGJiNTE0ZmNlMjJkMDBh">What had Vivi done this time?</p>
<p class="cnM4MzBiZDcyZWZhZTQzNjBhOTk4MGNjMTBkYTNlZTQ5">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="cnM3NWE0NzEyNGVjMjRiOGE5ODMwZTVkM2YxNzRkNzQ5">“How many spells do you <em>know?</em>” she asked, sounding almost horrified.</p>
<p class="cnNkNTdmNmVlOGJmOTRkMWNhZjk0M2RkOTFiNmM0YmI4">Vivi paused. Right. The thickness of her grimoire would indicate how large her arsenal was, wouldn’t it? And as an over-two-thousand who had picked up just about every spell in Seven Cataclysms that wasn’t locked behind a super high-tier subclass, the tome was impressively massive.</p>
<p class="cnMyZGYxZjBkNzY0ZTRjYTJhYTIwYjdiZmYwZGNmMWIw">“A few,” Vivi answered. “Why do ours look so different?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYTkwZDY0N2RiMTRjNWViMjVmMWRlMzNkYTRkMTll">“Grimoires change based on their owner. Class, level, and so on,” she said, staring at her dumbly even as she answered. “I’ve never seen anything like yours though. Not even the Headmaster’s comes close.”</p>
<p class="cnMxMzA5NzdmZmU2OTQxN2I4OGRmZDA4MmI2NmZiMjJl">“The Headmaster? Of the Institute?” Vivi dug through her memories. “Aeris?”</p>
<p class="cnMxMzVhMGRiYjc0MDRkNzFiNjY2ZTM3OGY5MTQ3ZGQw">The question seemed to dispel some of her astonishment. Her mouth stopped hanging open as she studied Vivi with a furrowed brow. “Archmage Aeris? No…he stepped down shortly after the Turning, I think. He’s a professor now.”</p>
<p class="cnNmNGRjODM2MGU2ZTQ5YmFhMzQwNDc4OGRhNzIwOGY3">“The Turning?”</p>
<p class="cnM2MjdmMjNlYTg2ZTRmZTg4YTkxYThjOTdmNGM5NDFj">“The day the Party of Heroes defeated the Seventh Cataclysm. You know Archmage Aeris?”</p>
<p class="cnMyNzkzNjcxYmIwMjQxNjRiM2FiM2IwYzlhZTBkOTdh">Vivi pursed her lips. “In a manner of speaking.” He had been moderately involved in the game’s plot, being one of humanity’s most powerful archmages. And also the headmaster of the Institute, thus appearing in various class quests. “Someone took his place?”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZTE4N2MxYmY2OTRiMWU5MmU1N2JlYjhhMGM2YWJi">“Archmage Lysander.” Her nose wrinkled. She wasn’t a fan, Vivi could tell.</p>
<p class="cnNhMThjMDUzNTY2YjQ5YzA5OGJkZDM4OWIzMzU4MGQ3">Speaking on this topic reminded her that Saffra had been expelled from the Institute for a yet unknown reason. She wondered whether she should press that matter.</p>
<p class="cnMzN2M0M2ViMDhiYzRiOGQ4ZWIyYmIwZTFmNjhiNjlj">She lifted the heavy tome with one hand and held it out to Saffra. “Trade.”</p>
<p class="cnMxNjMyNGI3NGVjYTRhZmU4NDYwMjliZTk3OTUzMDFi">Saffra froze. “What?”</p>
<p class="cnM4YjdkZWQzZmY1NTQzZjY5OWQwMWE5MTMxNWQ5YjBm">“Trade,” Vivi repeated, holding her other hand out and gesturing with a ‘give-me’ motion. “I’ll look through yours, as you offered, and you look through mine.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MjgzZGVlNmRjNzQ0NjFiODhlZjE0NWQwNTE2M2E2">Saffra continued doing her best impression of a statue. “You’re giving me your grimoire.”</p>
<p class="cnMyODE1YzdkM2M4OTQ3OTBhYTI4NzI5OTc5MjY0ODE2">“Stay to the first six tiers, don’t flip past that. Find something you want me to teach you. In the meantime, I’ll see what you’re working with.” She waggled the book impatiently.</p>
<p class="cnNjN2Y1OThjYjE1NDQ5ODQ5MGM4OTM0M2VhOTUyODlk">Saffra didn’t move an inch. Just sat there, wide-eyed. Was the offer that shocking?</p>
<p class="cnM5NWU5ZjA3YTcxZTQ1ZjM5MWI3YTRjZDNiMmQwY2Zh">“Take,” Vivi ordered, pushing the grimoire into Saffra’s hand.</p>
<p class="cnMxZjQ1MjA2ZGRmYTRhNWVhYWU2YjVlMGQ5MDgyNGZl">She finally seized the heavy obsidian tome, hastily handing over hers in return. Even when she had the book in her lap, though, she sat there, frozen, afraid to touch it. Her eyes flicked between Vivi and the grimoire repeatedly.</p>
<p class="cnM3YzM4NmViMzE1ODRiNGZiNDg2Y2NmYzM5NmYyMjAx">“<em>Open it</em>,” Vivi said dryly.</p>
<p class="cnMyMDQyMGIwYjVhYzQ0ZTViZWNjMzRlZjhkYTcxZGRh">Clearly, Saffra was finding this a much bigger deal than Vivi had assumed. She guessed having one of the world’s most thorough compendiums of magical knowledge dropped in one’s lap would be overwhelming to an aspiring mage—even if Vivi was only allowing her access to some of the lowest-tier magic she had.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZTA3OTA3MWUzODQ2YzI5OTNlZDU1Mzk1YzI5ZWZk">With the sort of slow and careful movement reserved for handling the most brittle artifact in the world, Saffra opened the heavy black cover of the obsidian grimoire. Her eyes widened as she drank in the sight of the first page, the tier-0 spell [Illuminate]. It really wasn’t impressive, so why did Saffra’s eyes keep rounding?</p>
<p class="cnM5N2VlMWQ4YjhjZTQ0OTBiM2FkMTZiNmE1ZWQwYTEz">“And find a spell you want to learn,” Vivi said. “I have [Flame Bolt] in there somewhere, if you want to improve on the design of one of your staple spells. Or pick a new one entirely. Your choice.”</p>
<p class="cnM4ZjY3M2YxYTk4MjQxZTdhZTFmMGIzMjljMzQ2NzNm">Saffra nodded rapidly, red hair bouncing with the motion, apparently mute.</p>
<p class="cnM3NDgwN2M0N2Y3YjQ0ODJhYjQxNWFlMjAwNmVlMGQ2">Having the girl look through only the first six tiers shouldn’t be an issue. There were some rather...<em>revealing</em> spells deeper in, but there was only so much insanity a mage could get up to in the lower tiers. Saffra already knew she was a ridiculously powerful mage, so exposing the first portion of her grimoire wouldn’t matter.</p>
<p class="cnM3NjQwMzE2NDljZTQzZTlhMGU1MGZmMzhlYTQ4YjRl">Vivi looked down at Saffra’s much smaller book. It was a plain thing, reddish leather tied with strings to hold a few dozen pages together. The grimoire of not a beginner, but also not someone even into gold rank.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjYyYTgwYTE3MzQ2MDQ4OWUxM2M5ZTc1ZDhiMzdk">Saffra was in the high three-hundreds, and while that was respectable, doubly so for her age, she’d only had time to pick up a few spells. A grimoire showcased breadth of knowledge, and Saffra was too young to have learned much more than the daily kit she used for adventuring. Especially having been expelled from her place of education. Vivi suspected a mage’s arsenal increased more than linearly with level and age, though probably not exponentially.</p>
<p class="cnNjYzM1NjI5ZDIwYTRmNmVhZGEzZDc3NTVmYjRlZjRh">She flipped through Saffra’s grimoire. As the young mage had told her, she knew a few utility spells—[Illuminate] served as a staple for how simple and useful it was to an adventurer, so it was the first spell in her book as well. Otherwise she had learned mostly elemental combat magic. Predominantly ice and fire, though two earth spells and a single air. [Fireball] occupied the last page, her only tier-five spell.</p>
<p class="cnNlZjk3ZmZlZmZlNDQ1ZDViZjA1ZTkyMmZiOTRhYjkw">“It’s nothing impressive, I know,” Saffra mumbled, her state of awe replaced with obvious insecurity, shoulders slightly hunched.</p>
<p class="cnM4MWYwMmUwYjI0MDRmMDQ5MmQyNmI5YTNmMThmMmMw">Vivi considered her. She leaned forward and, using the girl’s own grimoire, lightly smacked her on the top of the head. Her ears flattened in surprise, and she looked at Vivi with a startled expression.</p><span class="cjY4YWVjYjYzZDkwNDQ3ZDY5MWYxODhjYTc5ZGU5NDk0"><br>Unauthorized usage: this tale is on Amazon without the author's consent. Report any sightings.<br></span>
<p class="cnMzZTQxYzJmZjkzZjRiMWE4MzhjZDNmMzY0NmE2MjAw">“It’s the life work of a diligent, earnest young woman,” Vivi scolded. “I would ask that you don’t insult her right in front of me.”</p>
<p class="cnMwNzE4OWQ3ZGUwYjQ3Yjk4YWEyOTYxMjMzOWFhNDIz">Saffra stared at her for a long moment, then lifted Vivi’s grimoire to hide her rapidly reddening face.</p>
<p class="cnM5NmNkZWY4NjZhMTQ3MmY4NWUzYjZlZTgyMzQwYTgz">“R-Right,” she stammered. “Sorry.”</p>
<p class="cnNlMWNiZTgzYzNkZDRjYmViMzNlNjc0NGM5NDMzZDU0">Vivi shook her head, then returned to studying Saffra’s grimoire. This time, the spell circles in specific.</p>
<p class="cnNhM2E0ODcxYTk3OTQxMWU4YWQyZDk5YTJhMmU5MmI1">They were…not good. Horrible, to be honest. Vivi could improve Saffra’s general casting ability twofold simply by giving her better designs. She could also make ones from scratch if she wanted.</p>
<p class="cnM3NjlkMjA5MzkyNjRlZGY4Y2EyMWI5ODlhNjI5MWYz">The new spell circles wouldn’t even need to be more complex—they could be simpler <em>and </em>better than what Saffra had. Though the best would, admittedly, require techniques probably beyond the girl’s current ability.</p>
<p class="cnM3ZTgzYjgxMzYyYzQyZmRhZmIxYTYzYjNmYzkyNjkw">Saffra had mentioned that the best spells were hoarded within guilds and families. Even the Institute, an establishment of learning, didn’t yield its best to its students. She found herself deeply disapproving, but supposed humans were humans. It wasn’t like things worked differently in her world. People hoarded wealth and power there too. Why would it be different here?</p>
<p class="cnMwYzc4ZmQwNmE2YzQzOGFhY2U4MjU1YTQyYjQ3YzM0">It took Saffra ten minutes to find the spell she wanted to work on. Hesitantly holding Vivi’s grimoire up, she displayed the page describing [Scorchlance].</p>
<p class="cnM0NzgyZTg5MmFmZjQzYWM4NzE3OWNlNzgxMDQxMzBh">“An upgraded version of [Flame Bolt],” Vivi said. Saffra had said she used [Flame Bolt] most often through her adventures, a standard fire-type spell that balanced cast time and destructive potential. It was tier three, however, and [Scorchlance] tier four. As far as picking a single efficient upgrade to her overall combat potential, [Scorchlance] was a good choice. “Very well.”</p>
<p class="cnM2NmI3MDBjNDE0MzQxMTU5NzgyY2NiYTQyMTEwZjkw">They traded grimoires back.</p>
<p class="cnM1NWVmMDBhOTFiYTQ1ZDhhMDBkYzY5YzBiNzZmN2Rk">“Was that a test?” Saffra blurted out.</p>
<p class="cnNhNmQwOWQ5NzllZTQzNDQ5ODlhNzNjODFhMDBmMjMz">Vivi gave her a baffled expression. Or rather, that was what she felt internally. Like always, her face barely twitched.</p>
<p class="cnM0ZmFjMmRhZjZjZDRmNjZiOTA0Y2UxYzcyMDBmMTlj">“Like, I wasn’t supposed to get too greedy, or something,” Saffra mumbled.</p>
<p class="cnNjMTQ2NDRjYWUzZjRhNjE4MDBiMjRmNTM2NTVlZTFm">Ah. She <em>had </em>been surprised Saffra hadn’t gone for the highest-tier, flashiest, rarest spell she could find. There were a lot of unusual spells in her grimoire, even in the lower tiers. Her choice had been practical and efficient instead. This explained why.</p>
<p class="cnNmZGQ5NjI4YTdlZTRlMGI4MjA2NDNmZGM1Yzk4MDFl">“It wasn’t a test,” Vivi said, amused. “You can change your mind, though I do think this is a good starting point.”</p>
<p class="cnM3OGI3NGQwMTgzNzQyZjY4ZGQ3Mjc4NWQ0YTBiZjBh">“Starting point?”</p>
<p class="cnM3YTZiYjgzNmM5ODQwZGI4NmY1OTM5NjNhMWM1MTQz">Vivi tilted her head.</p>
<p class="cnM2MTYyM2UyNTM3ZTRkYWFhN2Q5YWUwZTIyNzZlNDgy">“…I’ll get to pick more?” Saffra asked hopefully.</p>
<p class="cnNmYTlkYjczNjkwMDQ1ODBhZmE0YjMzNTFmMTYwOGU1">“Of course. Once you’ve grasped this one.”</p>
<p class="cnM5OTBlOGU0ZDJhMjRiMGJhZTA1N2QyNGNiMTM2NmU5">Saffra bobbed her head eagerly, cat ears perking up at the news.</p>
<p class="cnNmOGVhZjM5ZjJmYjQ5M2M4YWQxMmNiZWUyYjM0ZDJh">The first lesson began. Everything prior had been more evaluation and planning. Now, Vivi drew mana from her core and painted it into runes on the air, tracing the spell circle slowly for Saffra’s sake. Saffra did her best to imitate her, though she was horribly clumsy in comparison.</p>
<p class="cnMxNjU1NmZmMDc5ZDQzNzBiYTExZGFlN2ViM2M5ZjJj">Vivi reminded herself that she had never struggled through any of this herself, and by all indicators Saffra was well above average. So it would be unreasonable to judge her by how easy the techniques seemed personally.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZjI3NjI4ZDJmMzRlN2ZhNGRlN2Q5YzJjN2UzZmYy">Patiently, she pointed out Saffra’s mistakes as she made them. Too much curve in that line, not thick enough there. Any time the spell circle had deviated far enough that she knew it wouldn’t activate—and probably run wild in the process—Vivi called the attempt off and had Saffra dissolve her mana and try again.</p>
<p class="cnM2OTQ3YWRjMGRjMzRiMjI5NmFiZjdhNmMwMDQwYTQ4">Moreover, she had Saffra redoing the same few runes over and over until they were meeting her standards—standards that weren’t anywhere near perfection, but Saffra struggled fiercely even so.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZmFiNDVlZGIyNzQ2MDRhY2ZiNGJlN2M1ZTAwMzVm">This was what she had meant when she said she wouldn’t make a good teacher. How strict should she be? Should she focus on getting Saffra to complete the spell circle to the bare minimum? Or should she insist on higher standards, even for a first cast?</p>
<p class="cnM2YzYyNWQ0M2FhODRhYjg4N2EyN2ZhNjYxOTIxNDA2">Her instincts told her to keep drilling Saffra until her runes met some minimum level of quality. But could she trust her instincts? They did come<em> </em>from one of, if not the, world’s best mortal casters, but who knew if that meant a good intuition for teaching?</p>
<p class="cnNlZjVjNDU1MTI0NDQ1MjE5N2Y3MTc3MGVlMWExMzNl">After an hour, Saffra couldn’t complete even twenty percent of the spell design to Vivi’s specifications. Vivi could feel a slight frown pulling on her lips as she decided to take a break, and the catgirl withered at it.</p>
<p class="cnM5NjM2MGNjMjUyNjQ5MDFiOTg5NmE2MjMwYzE0ZjFk">“I’ll do better next go,” she declared with false bravado, but she didn’t puff out her chest like usual. Instead, she stared at her lap, hands clenched.</p>
<p class="cnM3MTQ5ZTEwNzA1ODQwNjI4MjUwZWVjMjE0YTUwMzQx">Vivi was definitely failing as a teacher. Maybe transparency was best. “I expect you could have come much closer to activating the spell by now, but I want it done properly or not at all. It might be the wrong approach. As I said, I have no experience teaching.”</p>
<p class="cnNhMjlmYTU0MmEwYTRhZDA5ZDQ1Y2IxNzViMGVjNzY3">Saffra’s mood brightened at that. Maybe she had assumed that every time Vivi called an attempt off, it was because the spell would’ve failed.</p>
<p class="cnNjOWMzZmYxMDBmNjRmMTU4OTcxNGI3MGE1YmMxOTE1">“Oh. That’s not so bad then. Usually my Institute instructors focus on reaching invocation first, then refinement of the circle afterward.”</p>
<p class="cnM0MGFkMTFkOWIyODQyMmI4OGM3NjBhMTgxOGM5NTdk">Vivi pursed her lips. “I don’t know if that’s better. We’ll try my way first.” She would listen to her instincts unless given a strong reason not to. “I don’t want a shoddy first invocation—it needs to be at least acceptable.”</p>
<p class="cnMxZDM5N2M2MDEzMzQ3M2RhMzk5M2E2ZDM1ZjRiYmRl">Saffra nodded, encouraged. “I’ll do better next time,” she announced. She stole a glance toward the other side of the carriage. “And, um,” she said sheepishly, “I didn’t have breakfast, so would you mind if…?”</p>
<p class="cnMyYmUzYjg4NzZjZTRmMjM4NzU4YWVhMzAyMzZiYTk4">“Feel free.”</p>
<p class="cnM4NDk4Y2Q1MTE2NzRlMThiNjI3M2UzMzdjMDE1ZWVm">“I’ll get you something too!”</p>
<p class="cnM4MjMwMTQzZGY1NDQ3OTZiMWZlMzNmMWM3ZGQxYjYz">Vivi almost stood to join her, since she wanted to peruse the spread of food, but, while she wasn’t normally good with people, she sensed that Saffra wanted to do something ‘apprentice-y’ to give back to the dynamic somehow. So she let the girl trek off to put together two plates.</p>
<p class="cnNjZmRiNmE1NzljNTQwYjlhOGZkY2U2NjI4ODIyYjI0">They probably could have let the servants do it for them—they were stationed by the table still, and could have been hailed—but she hadn’t even considered it. In regard to ‘thinking like a commoner’, Vivi was no different from Saffra.</p>
<p class="cnMzYzdkYmYwODhjYzQzOGI4OTRlYzRiYmM3MGNhNDQy">She sank back into her seat and ruminated over the situation. Perhaps starting with a tier four spell had been too ambitious. Saffra technically wasn’t even at the standard level for tier fours yet, though she wasn’t far. Vivi’s rigorous requirements might be better applied to a lower-tier spell so Saffra wasn’t discouraged by being stuck on the same design for too long.</p>
<p class="cnM1MWRkZDRmODU5NTQ3N2ZiOTA2NGZhYTFkMjM2NTJj">And it would be a while yet. Despite Saffra’s fake-confident claims, they had only worked through a fifth of the spell circle, and the earlier parts were easiest because balancing and proportions mattered much less. The deeper into a design a mage went, the more the composition as a whole mattered, and thus difficulty and complexity rapidly grew.</p>
<p class="cnNhMmY4MThlYjI0ODQxZGQ4ZjcwMTg5ZjcxMmM4MWUx">Her thoughts were interrupted by a minor commotion. Vivi’s attention turned to the snack table—she wondered if there was a fancy word nobles used, since ‘snack table’ felt too pedestrian—to find that Saffra had been joined by the youngest of the nobles. The boy was probably around Saffra’s age, though a little shorter than her, and the effect was made more prominent by Saffra’s tall cat ears.</p>
<p class="cnM5M2RhZTZlYzgzOTQ0MjI5ZDFjYTM5NjJiNDE3MDIz">Saffra’s entire posture radiated discomfort. She was holding a plate which she’d been stacking food on, with another set aside presumably for Vivi. The boy was standing entirely too close, especially with the obvious signals Saffra was giving off.</p>
<p class="cnMzNDIwNzIwMTRhZTQ3ZjdiM2E2NmY2YzIyOGVlY2Zi">Vivi felt her hackles rise. She almost rose and stalked over, but calmed herself and honed her senses to listen in. Considering her stats, hearing across the carriage posed no challenge. Which was why she’d thrown up a silencing spell. If she could eavesdrop, other people could too.</p>
<p class="cnM3YjFiOTMwNzRkYjQ3NWFhMTA4MWYwMmU2YWYxZWIz">“You <em>decline</em>?” the boy asked, his words sharp with haughty indignation. “My father is merely interested in how a silver and a gold procured tickets into the Lounge. He wonders who his…<em>guests </em>are. You should be ecstatic to oblige his curiosity.”</p>
<p class="cnMxOGJlNzM3YTNkNjRhNTI5MTA5N2FiNWYwNGJhODNm">Ah. Vivi had expected this to rear its head again. She’d tentatively given credit to Lord Barnaby Caldimore—who she was fairly certain was this boy’s father—for brushing past the minor offense Vivi had given, but apparently she would have to retract that recognition.</p>
<p class="cnM4N2U0OTU3OTVmZjQ5YThhNDc1NjJhMjU0MWFjMjJh">He’d sent his son after Saffra. Vivi would have been ten times more forgiving if he’d confronted her directly.</p>
<p class="cnM1NjdlMGVlMTQ3ZDRmMjhiNzFkYzg4ZDFhMWNmNjI2">“I should get back, my lord,” Saffra said, sounding almost frightened, not at all like her usual self.</p>
<p class="cnM0M2FlMzAxNTc1MzRhZmU5ZGI3OGExODg2YmJiOTgw">Vivi had to remind herself that nobility <em>were</em> important in this world, and made for dangerous people to offend. Her own blasé attitude born from experiences on Earth was simply inappropriate. Even Saffra, normally spirited, didn’t let herself get an attitude with a noble’s son. She clearly wanted to be anywhere else.</p>
<p class="cnMyMmZkZGRiOWE0MzRkZmNiYmM5ZTI2NGE2MWUxOTRh">Saffra tried to edge away, and the boy reached out and grabbed her arm.</p>
<p class="cnMzMmM3NGVmNDZhNTQ0MDVhMGQwYWIxZDU4NGM4NWFi">That erased whatever traces of Vivi’s patience had remained. [Telekinesis] formed, and she seized the boy’s hand, pried his fingers open, and bodily grabbed him and slid him across the carpet, putting six feet between him and Saffra. Not roughly, of course—the brat wasn’t even a teenager, and his behavior was probably a parenting issue. Not to excuse it, of course. But she wasn’t going to hurt a child.</p>
<p class="cnM4MmNiYzg2NTgxNDQ1YmQ4Y2ZiNDNjNGMyMTQ3NzE5">Unfortunately, she wasn’t the only person watching the exchange. It had drawn the attention of everyone in the relatively small carriage. Lord Barnaby Caldimore bolted to his feet and spun, face beet-red and body vibrating with such outrage that she was almost impressed by how fast it happened.</p>
<p class="cnM5MzhhZjU4NjZhYTQ2NjBhYmMxZDNmOWIwZDI5MWFk">He pointed a wobbling finger at Vivi and thundered, “You<em> dare </em>lay hands on my son!”</p>
<p class="cnM3MWVmNzBkOWIxMjRmNjE5NGIyYzczNjQ5NDE1M2Jk">She guessed this had been inevitable.</p>

## Chapter 20: 20 - Goad


                <p class="cnMyNmRmMzkxYzk5MDQ0Y2E4NTNiZjM3MzIzYWVjMjA3">All eyes fell on Vivi following Lord Caldimore’s outburst. She didn’t like being the center of attention, but she’d been put in the spotlight frequently since her arrival in this world. She expected she would need to get used to it.</p>
<p class="cnM4N2Q2Mzk5YWViMDRmMjI5MzMzZjBmMDUwMTE5NjA2">Temporarily ignoring Caldimore, her gaze slid to Saffra. The boy next to her was clearly affronted at having been grabbed by a spell, but was also watching his father with eager excitement for how this would unfold. Saffra herself had gone pale-faced.</p>
<p class="cnM5MDQwZWY3ZTEyNjQ2ZjFiZTNhNTFmZWU5NWNkNDUz">Vivi clamped down on her anger. If this event had only involved her, she wouldn’t have been half as annoyed. But Saffra had been dragged into the middle of it.</p>
<p class="cnNkZDQ5YTA2NWFhOTRjM2VhYjEzYzc5MmExN2U4N2Y5">She gestured for the girl to join her, and she obeyed, abandoning the plates to scurry over.</p>
<p class="cnMyMjc3ZmE5Zjc3OTRlNzNiY2I2N2RkMWE4N2Q1OTc4">“Sorry…” she mumbled.</p>
<p class="cnNmYWRmYWUyOWEzMTQ5NjlhYjA3OTc5YTUyMDRhMDE0">Vivi bit down on her response. <em>Sorry?</em> For what? As if this was her fault in any way? She would deal with that in a second.</p>
<p class="cnMzYTI0NjJlMjY2ZTQ1OWZiNmU2OGFhN2FhM2M4MGM5">Lord Caldimore had stomped up to Vivi. “You dare assault my son?” he bellowed. “I don’t care whose student or child you are, brat, I will not stand for this.”</p>
<p class="cnMzYjI3NzJlOWFlNjRkMjA5ZWZjYzVkNmFjN2QzYjMx">Child? Her eye twitched, but she kept a lid on her temper.</p>
<p class="cnM4ZDMyNGQ0MTRjMDQ3YzQ4MTY1ZWE0NGYyZThjY2U2">“He grabbed my apprentice,” Vivi said, trying to take a moderated tone, but the words came out frosty even to her ears. “I reacted accordingly.”</p>
<p class="cnMyNmI4ZDY1YzViNjRkNjM4OTU0ODRjNTQ0YzBiN2Q3">He seemed taken aback by the word ‘apprentice’, but barreled forward a second later.</p>
<p class="cnM0YjRjMWFkYWZlNDQzOWJhN2NkYmQ2MTk5ZDQwYzZl">“Accordingly? No court in the land would classify what you’ve done as anything <em>but</em> assault by magical force. Against a scion of a noble house, no less. Know your place, child.”</p>
<p class="cnMxODNkM2U0YmM2ZDQwNDM5MjYzNGE0Njg3YTk4OTZi">Vivi opened her mouth to say something that would have escalated this beyond any chance for a peaceful resolution, but she was interrupted by laughter—laughter that drew everyone’s attention away from Vivi and Lord Caldimore.</p>
<p class="cnMwZTgxMDExMzM2ZTQxZmZhZTdiMDlhYzY0M2FkMzY1">It was the orichalcum-rank, Jasper. She had forgotten about him.</p>
<p class="cnNhMTE5MTc4MjI0NTQzNGY5ZGM4MDEzODljMGZjMjRk">“Oh, don’t mind me,” he said, his mirth clear. “This is gonna be hilarious.” He lifted his wine bottle to his lips, but paused, grimaced, and slowly lowered it. “Then again,” he sighed, “we’re stuck for another ten hours together.”</p>
<p class="cnMyYjRiN2M2NjA4NTRjZDI5M2RlZjQ4Y2JlOWE2MmE3">He tapped a finger against the seat’s armrest before coming to a decision.</p>
<p class="cnNhZTA0MmI0YTVhYzQ0YjQ4MDU3MWY1MmQ0MzNmMDUx">Unexpectedly, he faced, of all people, the maid who hovered behind Lord Caldimore’s right shoulder.</p>
<p class="cnMyY2M3NDExODNkYjRhMTI4MDU5NDRiNjc1ODdmMDcw">“I have to ask,” he said to her. “Why do you do it?”</p>
<p class="cnMyM2Y5ZGJlNzBhYzRjMTk4MzJiNjg4MWNiZmI4YjA5">The maid’s face remained calm and impassive. “Do what, Lord Adventurer?”</p>
<p class="cnNkMjAwMjIzNzBjNDQ3M2Q5OWQ3YzIzZWQ1MzMxZTQ0">“Serve people like him.”</p>
<p class="cnNkNjlmZjljMDczNTQwYjhhNGZmNjJlN2Y3MTZlMTc0">A long, pregnant pause. When she responded, there was a hint of danger in her otherwise polite tone. “I warn you, sir, I will not suffer aspersions cast on my lord’s name.”</p>
<p class="cnMzMWM0M2VkN2I0YTRkYjdiYjA3OTFhZTZlYjU3ZjMz">“Of course, of course,” he said, rolling his eyes. “I meant no offense. But I do wonder.” He hummed. “If we fought, which of us would win?”</p>
<p class="cnNhNmJlOWU2NzJkYzRlNWRiOWY3M2NkM2FjMTEwNzI5">At the seemingly random question, the maid returned a level gaze. Maybe because she didn’t know where he was going. Vivi didn’t, at least.</p>
<p class="cnNiZDExNWRkN2U0ODQxODI5MmI5ZjVhM2FmYjEwNTk5">His smile widened. “It wouldn’t be close, would it?” His eyes flicked to her lapel. Vivi noticed there were two thin pieces of metal pinned there. “I’ve seen your kind before. Second Class. Less than one in ten White Gloves reach that rank. You’re a monster even among those monsters you call peers.”</p>
<p class="cnM4MmE0OWE4MGE4MjRjNDQ4NjhmODNmZmQxNGQ2OGFl">The maid said nothing. Jasper seemed to be enjoying himself. “If I tried to attack that man.” He gestured at Lord Caldimore with his bottle of wine. “There wouldn’t be much left of me besides a smear afterward. What kind of fortune does it cost to hire you, even for a week?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NzZmNGE4MWIwMDQ4MDhhYjUyZWQzNzI1ZjYyYzAx">Lord Caldimore was apparently done humoring Jasper. “What is the meaning of this?” he demanded. “What are your implications?”</p>
<p class="cnNjYjU3YjQwYmViYjQ1ZDQ5ZmZjNjQ0YzcxOWM1N2Ez">Jasper sighed, his amusement swapping to irritation in an instant. He turned a disdainful look toward the nobleman. “As hilarious as this would be, we have a long ride ahead. Consider this a friendly suggestion, <em>Lord Caldimore</em>. Ask your White Glove what she thinks of this ‘child’ you’ve blindly picked a fight with. She’s a keen woman. I think she’ll have something interesting to say.”</p>
<p class="cnM1NzhmNzgyN2UyMDQwYTM5ZTBlNTJlNWQ1Y2M0OWZm">The maid’s gaze turned to Vivi. Those pale blue eyes appraised her with an utterly blank expression. Paying closer attention, though, Vivi noticed how tense she was underneath the elegant poise.</p>
<p class="cnM0MThlYmU2NzRlNTQ1MmJiMTQ2NTc1NTM5ZWQ4Yzgz">Ah. She supposed a woman from an elite bodyguarding organization was capable of recognizing threats to her client’s health. She wasn’t half as idiotic as the man she was serving.</p>
<p class="cnMyYjQ0YzlkY2Q1YzQzYTE5ZGZmOTljYzM5YmVhNWE5">Lord Barnaby Caldimore’s face reddened, but he wasn’t so rash as to discard an orichalcum-rank adventurer’s advice—however rudely offered.</p>
<p class="cnNlMjRjNDQ3ZTQ4MTQ4ZWFhMTAxZjZiMzgwNjZiYjcz">He stiffly turned to the maid and said, “Explain.”</p>
<p class="cnM1OWVhYWRlYWRlMzQzOTlhOWI4NWYyZTUxMWJhZWZj">The maid was quiet for a long time. She didn’t turn and meet Lord Caldimore’s eyes when she finally answered, and that seemed to unnerve the man, the way she kept her gaze locked purely on her potential opponent. As if refusing to allow even a fraction of an opening.</p>
<p class="cnNlMmZjYWJkMjE0NzQ4ZTBiZjZiOGRmODRjYzk4NGRh">“She sees me as no threat whatsoever,” the maid said calmly. “I would advise against escalating tensions, my lord.”</p>
<p class="cnMzZWVlMDk0NjQ5MjRmZWY4OWZmYjk1MjEzYjY0OWIw">He was nothing less than dumbfounded at the words. “She’s a gold rank!”</p>
<p class="cnMyNWZjYmVmMzBhMDQwMTliMzEyYjA1NmUzNDkxNjk5">The sound of a palm hitting a face drew everyone’s attention. “This is what I mean,” Jasper exclaimed to the maid. “Why him? You have your choice of assignments, surely. He’s a complete—”</p>
<p class="cnM1NjYxNzM1NmY5ODQ4N2Q4ZDkzMzMyZDAwN2M1NTJj">“If you finish that sentence, Lord Adventurer,” the maid interrupted, “there will be no recourse but one. I will<em> not</em> suffer aspersions cast on my lord’s name.”</p>
<p class="cnNiOTM5MmQ2ZDBkZDRkNGNiYjRjOTFiMDRlNzRiNGFi">Even Jasper’s cavalier attitude heeded that warning. His teeth clicked shut. He pursed his lips, obviously unhappy, and nodded stiffly at the woman.</p><span class="cjkzYWQwNWYyNmVhMDQ1OGZhMGQ3OGYyMDY0ZDY5ODAz"><br>The narrative has been illicitly obtained; should you discover it on Amazon, report the violation.<br></span>
<p class="cnNkN2U4OTkwM2I1MzQ5OGNhZTAxMjk2OWQ3OGFlY2M0">He did make a show of peeling off his orichalcum-rank badge, summoning a gold-rank one from his inventory and pinning it to his chest. He flourished both hands at the badge, then fell back into his chair with an eye roll.</p>
<p class="cnNlMGZiZWRhNmYwYzQ4Njk5NzRmNjA2MmIxNDg4MGMw">Lord Caldimore gaped between the three of them. His gaze finally settled on Vivi.</p>
<p class="cnMyYWEwNWJiYzI4OTQzZjFiYmEzMGY0ZGM0YWFmNGU0">She could see the moment the reality of the situation set in. He was abruptly sweating, the moral outrage disappearing like a switch had been flipped. Vivi suspected he’d just wanted to rant and throw his weight around, more than he was actually offended—though he really had been affronted.</p>
<p class="cnM1MTQyMDIwODFhODQzZDliNzFkMTM0ZjM4MWU3YmE3">“Does make me wonder what kind of monster you are, though,” Jasper said to Vivi, clearly enjoying the show being put on, “to scare a Glove of the Second Class. What dark crevice did you crawl out of? Heard all sorts of stories like this, mysterious mages showing up out of nowhere.” He took a long swig from his bottle. “Let me guess. Dragon in disguise, come to play with the mortals. What do you think of us so far?”</p>
<p class="cnMzYWIxYmY2NzVhOTRhMzZiM2NkZmI2YzU2NWVmYjgx">Vivi could feel Saffra’s wide eyes turn to her, as if genuinely considering the possibility.</p>
<p class="cnM2ZmUwYmYxMjdhZjRhN2E5ZDk3NDNmMjJmODcwZWU0">She gave an annoyed look to the man and briefly considered whether teleporting him out of the carriage would be an overreaction.</p>
<p class="cnNiMWVmYmUxOGQzNTQ4YzNiM2ZjNzVlNTE4MjhkODRi">He raised his hands in mock surrender. “Please don’t eat me, Great Serpent Queen. Not in public, at least.” He winked at her. “Behind closed doors is another matter.”</p>
<p class="cnNhNjM2YzdjOGYxNDQyYTY4MDQzODAwMjhjNDZlYzdh">Vivi was impressed at the audacity, if nothing else. Making an actual <em>innuendo </em>gave her the justification she needed. She pulled her staff out, pointed, and cast a spell.</p>
<p class="cnM1YzY4NDRiMTVhZDRmZjRiMzQxOWEzNTRlODYzNDgz">The wine bottle vanished. The man tensed, then relaxed at seeing he wasn’t about to be in a fight.</p>
<p class="cnM0YTA4YTg1MzczYjRiZWI4NjJjZjBkYmU4YjRlYzcw">“I wasn’t done with that.”</p>
<p class="cnNhYTJkOWFiNDM2MzRmMWI5YjY4OTcxNjk4OWJmMzhl">“If I <em>were </em>so dangerous, why are you goading me?”</p>
<p class="cnM4MzA1YzNhNmNjYTQ0ZWRiZTAzNGZmODZhNDM2ZTIz">“Mae says I have a death wish. But really, I just like poking bears. It’s fun. Try it sometime.”</p>
<p class="cnMzYjc2MzM0YjlmODRlMmQ5OTgwM2E2YTJmYTI1NjBj">“Seems like it could very easily backfire.”</p>
<p class="cnMzNzUyMmU2ZTFmMTQyYmFiYmNjMmRlNGI4MDliNzAw">He cracked a lopsided grin. “That’s <em>why</em> it’s fun.”</p>
<p class="cnM1MjRhYTJmNTQwNDQ4MTdhNDllN2JkMmFhM2Q2YWQz">She shook her head and put him out of mind. Facing Lord Caldimore, she said, “When a young woman attempts to excuse herself, is grabbing her by the arm appropriate behavior?”</p>
<p class="cnNiNTJhYzVkMGZiYTQ3ZDJhODAzMmY4Y2QzMTcwMTVk">His expression soured, and he shot a displeased look at his son, who had gone pale at the preceding exchanges. “That was unbecoming for one of his lineage,” he gritted out, “and I will not contest that fact. Nevertheless, he is young and entitled to some indiscretions. Your reaction was disproportionate.”</p>
<p class="cnNkZDg2OTAwNjEwZjRmMjRiZmZiN2FiYTNiZmNiMmQx">Unsurprisingly, there wasn’t much real remorse in his words. He had taken a more levelheaded tone than before, and clearly wasn’t enjoying the confrontation anymore, but his pride—the fact he was being watched by a number of his lackeys—prevented him from backing down entirely.</p>
<p class="cnNmZjY4ZjFlZWU5ZjQ0NjliNTk1MTkzNjE3Nzg4NDVk">Vivi wondered how to handle this. Her annoyance had simmered because of Jasper’s interruption. Actually—had that been intentional?</p>
<p class="cnNiMWQxMmVhNWU1YjQxODI5OThmMjlhZTVlNmYwZTZh">She was still plenty irritated though. But where she’d been ready to put this man into his place, forcefully if need be, now she just wanted it done with. He’d been cowed. He was just trapped by a need to maintain appearances.</p>
<p class="cnNkZTYwZmE4Mjc0NTQ0ZGViMjhjNmEyMzUzNzAyYjYz">“I assure you, my reaction was proportionate,” Vivi said coldly. “Involve my apprentice a second time, and I will show you a response that is not.”</p>
<p class="cnM0ZTQ1OTVkNDE2NjQ4OGQ4NjlhMDI0M2EwYjI2MDEz">Turning, she pulled Saffra with her to their spot at the far end of the carriage. Lord Caldimore, wisely, did not stop her.</p>
<p class="cnNjYmQyZDU3NWJiYjQ4YjVhZTlkNTRiNGU0OWUyNjEz">Saffra was on edge when they sat.</p>
<p class="cnM1ZmRiODAwNDU5MzQyMjY5OTljNDQxZWQ3NjhjOTg5">Vivi frowned at her. “There’s only one thing you did wrong, and I expect you don’t know what it is.”</p>
<p class="cnNmYzhlMzljZjgyYTQ1MDU5MWYyODA0Zjg2NTFmM2Fj">Saffra blinked.</p>
<p class="cnMzY2Q0ODc0MjkyYjQxMmE5NzhjM2Q4ODZlZDAyYjZl">“Why did you apologize?”</p>
<p class="cnM2NGJhYjhhMzc0MTQ0Yjc5ODdlMmMzOWRkYTc2Njk1">That wasn’t what she’d expected, clearly, which was the problem in the first place. “What?”</p>
<p class="cnMxYWVlZGZjMmQ4YjQwZjJhODY1YTQyOGJmNjExYzI4">“Why did you apologize? For what?”</p>
<p class="cnM1NDRmODA5ZDkyNTQyNzBhMmI0YWMxZGE0OWY3YWZm">“I…it was my fault that…”</p>
<p class="cnMxMDZkMWUwYzM1YTQ2Njc5ZDVmNWM4NzY1ZmU0MzIx">“It was <em>your</em> fault?”</p>
<p class="cnMyOGMxNmIwNTc5NTQwMDhhZGFjZjFmOGE5YjVmNzMw">“Well…no. But it still happened because of me.”</p>
<p class="cnMzM2VhNmI4NmM0ODRiODM4MTIyYWU5N2U3NjMzNTky">“You know it didn’t.” Vivi shook her head. “I shouldn’t be scolding. I’m sorry that happened. But don’t blame yourself for things that clearly aren’t your fault. That’s my first rule from master to apprentice.”</p>
<p class="cnMzYjFlNmNhZDQ2MDRhMjI4ZWZmMGFmN2U1YmEzYzAx">Hesitantly, Saffra gave a slow nod.</p>
<p class="cnMwMDdlYTc3NWYxODRiZjdiZGVhZGViMTFjZmExNDZm">Movement in the corner of her eye caught her attention, and Vivi looked over to see a butler carrying two plates.</p>
<p class="cnNlYjkxYWZmOWY5YTQ3MTFhZmI3MDlmZjdkMGUyYzU0">He cleared his throat. “Sorry to interrupt. These were yours, I believe, my lady?”</p>
<p class="cnMzYTNmMjU0OGU3ZDQ4YWY5MGNhNTg1NmEyN2E5ZWE5">Saffra flushed and took them, checking the plates and handing Vivi hers. The butler bowed deeply and left. Vivi and Saffra came to a silent, mutual agreement to put the debacle out of mind.</p>
<p class="cnM1YzA0ZTBlYTkzMjRmY2Q4NjMwOTc1MTEyMjc2YjBm">Vivi looked at the assortment of food. The plate was covered with tiny sandwiches with green filling, golden tarts with white cream and other pastries, assortments of fruit, and pieces of what she assumed was chocolate. Plucking one of the sweets up first, she confirmed the fact: definitely chocolate. A little more bitter than what she was used to, but made of quality ingredients.</p>
<p class="cnMwYjlmZjE2YWM0MjRiZTNhM2NiZTUwNGYyYjhjNzBh">“Thank you,” Vivi said, and Saffra dipped her head.</p>
<p class="cnM2MmZkODMwZmZkYTRlNjM5NjQyYTYzMGMzZjQ4Yzkw">A minute of sampling the food later, Vivi said wryly, “I think we would have been more comfortable in a different carriage. At least we’ll be able to downgrade”—not that it would be a downgrade—”at the next station.”</p>
<p class="cnM3MjQwYzQ0ZGQxYzQyNzk5YmRiNjhmNDdiNTQyYmEy">“It is a bit tense,” Saffra admitted, sneaking a look that was, thankfully, now more amused than worried toward the group of noblemen. The men had reclaimed their seats and were purposefully not looking their way. “If I’m being honest, I—”</p>
<p class="cnNiZDk0NGQxYWVmMDQyMDdhMWE3ZTQ5OWJkNDdlMDAx">Saffra’s hand had been sneaking up to her neck, a habit Vivi had seen a few times, but she froze as her fingers didn’t find the silver chain that usually hung there. Whatever she’d been about to say cut off. She groped around, gaze snapping down in horror.</p>
<p class="cnM3MWJjZWE1MWQ3NzQwMDZiYjNlNDA3MTM5Mjg4MjY2">“What is it?” Vivi asked, though it was hardly difficult to guess.</p>
<p class="cnM1NzI1ZTk4MjIyMDQwNTFhM2FjNjkyOWMzYTkzMjVh">Saffra ignored her. She dragged her pack over and began tearing through it, panic rising with every item she ripped out.</p>
<p class="cnM5MTg3YjZlMjdhNjQ5YjU5YzVlYjQ1Y2UwMjA2NGQ0">“Saffra,” Vivi said, but the girl ignored her. Her concern grew. Obviously, the necklace she’d misplaced was more than just something she liked wearing around. “Saffra, calm down.”</p>
<p class="cnNkMGM4NDMxN2U2NTRhMjQ5ZjNkZjIzMDA3OWI5OWY1">She considered stopping her, but let the girl go through her frantic motions. For all Vivi knew, she might actually find it.</p>
<p class="cnMxMzQ3MzdiYjkwYzRkZTliN2Y5MDE4MjZlOWM2YWFi">Eventually, Saffra sagged into her seat with a shell-shocked expression.</p>
<p class="cnMyZWRmNmYyZWZjMzQwNzZiODg3M2JkMWNmNjIyZDU0">“Where did you see it last?”</p>
<p class="cnMxZjAzOTYwOGFiYTRkMDRiNTBhNGRhN2MxOThmYmVi">“What?” Saffra only then seemed to realize Vivi had been watching the whole event. She didn’t even grow embarrassed—she was too miserable. “I…it should have been…” She bit her lip as she tried to remember. Her eyes squeezed shut in sudden realization. “My room at the Guild. I took it off last night. It must have gotten lost in the sheets, and I didn’t remember to look for it when I woke up.”</p>
<p class="cnNlZTI5YjQ4MjBmYzQ0ODViMDVhMjI3M2MwODdjN2E4">Vivi nodded. “Give me a strand of your hair.”</p>
<p class="cnNlM2FiMjhhYWM4MjQ3NDQ4NjNiZTlhMjZhOWE5YzQz">“What?”</p>
<p class="cnNjNGQyYWQ5N2FjOTRhNjRiNWY2OTMwMjVhZWJmMDIy">She supposed it was a strange request to ask out of nowhere. “For a [Locate Object] spell. I’ll go and retrieve it.”</p>
<p class="cnNmMDJlMTkxZWExMjRjODA5MjNhYjA3YzEwNDRiYTY2">“…What?” Saffra looked out the nearest window at the blurring landscape beyond. “We’re hours away. By Convoy.”</p>
<p class="cnM5NDA1NmQzNGI3MjRkNmE4ZWFlZTZiYzBmNTdkNDE0">“It shouldn’t take more than an hour or two.” She had a warp point in Prismarche, naturally, and she could place one right outside the train to reduce how many [Blinks] she needed to catch up. “Hair, please.”</p>
<p class="cnNlNzg1YzU1MTI5YzRmYzZiOWZmMmM4ZjVmODFiMTA0">She could wait until they reached the next city, but she worried that something would happen to the necklace in the meantime—perhaps it would be scooped up with the sheets and laundered, ruining it somehow, or maybe be stolen. She had magical solutions for either of those cases, but for an item so clearly important to Saffra, she would rather just go fetch it.</p>
<p class="cnMzNWFlODI1ZmNjMDQ3NzViZDk3MWEwM2Q5YmFmMjk4">Returning to Prismarche to check in on the dimensional anomaly was worth a trip anyway. Knowing she’d left a city of vulnerable people behind with that thing hanging over their heads made her skin itch. There was no harm in verifying it was still stable—maybe even it was a good thing she’d been given an excuse to go look. Plus, there were the two prisoners. Also worth checking on.</p>
<p class="cnM2MDIwOGZjMDIzMzQwNDdiYzlmZGU5MmQxNGY0NmM2">“But how?” Saffra shook her head, probably coming to her own conclusions. “No, it’s fine.” It clearly wasn’t. “You don’t need to do that. I’ve already been so much trouble…”</p>
<p class="cnNkOTI5NjFhOTYwZjQxNmE4YmVhYTBjNTgwNDE5NWNj">Vivi gave her a look. “You haven’t been <em>any </em>trouble. And I have my own business that makes the trip worth it. It’s a simple errand.” She held her hand out.</p>
<p class="cnNmODMyYmM2Nzc1YTQwODJiZGMxZmVhMjY0OTYzYWFj">Saffra seemed, if guiltily, immensely relieved. She plucked out some strands of red hair and gave them to Vivi, who stored them in her inventory.</p>
<p class="cnM3NjFjMTEwZmMyODRkOGM5YTdiOTcyOTc1OGJlMzYw">Before [Blinking] out of the Convoy to set a [Warp Anchor] near the tracks, Vivi paused. Her eyes slid over to the disgruntled group of noblemen. They wouldn’t try anything while she was gone, surely, but best to be safe.</p>
<p class="cnM3MDkyNzU2NGJkZTRhMTU4NWU4ZTNkNmY5NTllYzE0">“I’m going to put some defensive spells on you, just in case,” Vivi told Saffra. And by that, she meant her highest-tier defensive ones. The full array. The Ashen Hierophant himself would struggle to break through. “And if they try anything, tell them I’ll be back shortly, and <em>very </em>displeased.”</p>
